All of the ossicles move more or less as a unit, at least at low frequencies.\n\nWhen the eardrum is moved inward due to sound vibrations, transferred through the outer ear, it transmits to the handle or manubrium of the malleus which is connected to the ear drum. The head of the malleus (caput mallei) moves with it and transfers energy/movement to the corpus of the incus (corpus incudis), which is located directly behind. The sound vibrations are then transferred to the stapes (stirrup) through the incudostapedial joint.", "response": "The function of the incudomalleolar joint is to transfer vibrations between the ossicles in the middle ear.", "category": "closed_qa"}

They may protect water supplies, yield wood, harbor wildlife,and provide space to recreate.We are concerned about the level of harvest, the adjacent land use, pollution from nearby industries, or where forests burn. Informed management requires knowledge of all these related factors and, perhaps above all, the spatial arrangement of these factors. Buffer strips near rivers may protect water supplies,clearings may prevent the spread of fire, and polluters upwind may harm our forests.

Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.", "response": "The primary physical causes or drivers of climate change are:\n- Humans burning fossil fuels\n- Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide\n- Aerosols such as sulfur dioxide, organic carbon, black carbon and ammonia", "category": "summarization"}

In what we could call a normal household, the mother is responsible for the well being of their child until they become an adult at the age of 18.  During those 18 years, they take them to the doctors, make sure they attend school, participate in extracurricular activities, and be an active member of the community.  They say it takes a village to raise a child, but raising that child starts with being a good mother.  While they are doing all of this for their own child(ren) they are also taking care of themselves, their household, their spouse and in a lot of cases their own career.

Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in damping factor before the voice coil[30]", "response": "A passive crossover is a loudspeaker circuit comprised of resistors, inductors, and capacitors.", "category": "information_extraction"}

At the same time, the index needs to be kept up-to-date with the table, which means that each table update (insertion or deletion of new rows, or updates to existing rows for the columns that the index covers) will now cost more as the relational database system has to also propagate the update to the index.
