The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar, at the foot of which is a densely populated town area, home to over 32,000 people, primarily Gibraltarians.[10]\n\nIn 1704, Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It became an important base for the Royal Navy, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II, as it controlled the narrow entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar, which is only 14.3 km (8.9 mi) wide. This choke point remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through it.[11][12][13] Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and bunkering.[14][15][16][17]\n\nThe sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations, as Spain asserts a claim to the territory.[15][18] Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum, and for shared sovereignty in a 2002 referendum. Nevertheless, Gibraltar maintains close economic and cultural links with Spain, with many Gibraltarians speaking Spanish as well as a local dialect known as Llanito.\n\nSince Brexit, Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union but negotiations are underway to have it participate in the Schengen Agreement to facilitate border movements between Gibraltar and Spain.[19] As of March 2023, talks seem deadlocked.[20]\n\nName\nThe name is derived from Arabic: جبل طارق, romanized: Jabal Ṭāriq, lit. 'Mount of Tariq' (named after the 8th-century Moorish military leader Tariq ibn Ziyad).[21]", "response": "The name comes from the arabic meaning the mountain of Tarik", "category": "closed_qa"}

Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.\n\nAll substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility.[1] Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.", "response": "Magnetism is defined as the physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which is the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive forces.

Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\n\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\n\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s.

Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.[1] Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies.\n\nCoffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720.

{"instruction": "Based on the reference text, provide a summary of how the monthly benefit amount for social security is calculated.", "context": "Primary Insurance Amount and Monthly Benefit Amount calculations\nMain article: Primary Insurance Amount\nWorkers in Social Security covered employment pay FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or SECA (Self Employed Contributions Act) taxes and earn quarters of coverage if earnings are above minimum amounts specified in the law. Workers with 40 quarters of coverage (QC) are \"fully insured\" and eligible for retirement benefits. Retirement benefit amounts depend upon the average of the person's highest 35 years of \"adjusted\" or \"indexed\" earnings. A person's payroll-taxable earnings from earlier years are adjusted for economy-wide wage growth, using the national average wage index (AWI), and then averaged.[31] If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings these non-contributory years are assigned zero earnings. The sum of the highest 35 years of adjusted or indexed earnings divided by 420 (35 years times 12 months per year) produces a person's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings or AIME.[31]\n\nThe AIME is then used to calculate the Primary Insurance Amount or PIA. For workers who turn 62 in 2021, the PIA computation formula is:\n\n(a) 90 percent of the first $996 of average indexed monthly earnings, plus\n\n(b) 32 percent of average indexed monthly earnings between $996 and $6,002, plus\n\n(c) 15 percent of average indexed monthly earnings over $6,002[32]\n\nFor workers who turn 62 in the future, the 90, 32, and 15 percent factors in the computation formula will remain the same but the dollar amounts in the formula (called bend points) will increase by wage growth in the national economy, as measured by the AWI. Because the AIME and the PIA calculation incorporate the AWI, Social Security benefits are said to be wage indexed. Because wages typically grow faster than prices, the PIAs for workers turning 62 in the future will tend to be higher in real terms but similar relative to average earnings in the economy at the time age 62 is attained.\n\nMonthly benefit amounts are based on the PIA. Once the PIA is computed, it is indexed for price inflation over time. Thus, Social Security monthly benefit amounts retain their purchasing power throughout a person's retirement years.\n\nA worker who first starts receiving a retirement benefit at the full retirement age receives a monthly benefit amount equal to 100 percent of the PIA. A worker who claims the retirement benefit before the full retirement age receives a reduced monthly benefit amount and a worker who claims at an age after the full retirement age (up to age 70) receives an increased monthly amount.[33]\n\nThe 90, 32, and 15 percent factors in the PIA computation lead to higher replacement rates for persons with lower career earnings. For example, a retired individual whose average earnings are below the first bend point can receive a monthly benefit at the full retirement age that equals 90 percent of the person's average monthly earnings before retirement. The table shows replacement rates for workers who turned 62 in 2013.\n\nThe PIA computation formula for disabled workers parallels that for retired workers except the AIME is based on fewer years to reflect disablement before age 62. The monthly benefit amount of a disabled worker is 100 percent of PIA.\n\nBenefits for spouses, children, and widow(er)s depend on the PIAs of a spouse or a deceased spouse. Aged spouse and divorced spouse beneficiaries can receive up to 50 percent of the PIA. Survivor benefit rates are higher and aged widow(er)s and aged surviving divorced spouses can receive 100 percent of the PIA.\n\nFederal, state and local employees who have elected (when they could) NOT to pay FICA taxes are eligible for a reduced FICA benefits and full Medicare coverage if they have more than forty quarters of qualifying Social Security covered work. To minimize the Social Security payments to those who have not contributed to FICA for 35+ years and are eligible for federal, state and local benefits, which are usually more generous, Congress passed the Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP.[36] The WEP provision will not eliminate all Social Security or Medicare eligibility if the worker has 40 quarters of qualifying income, but calculates the benefit payments by reducing the 90% multiplier in the first PIA bendpoint to 40–85% depending on the number of Years of Coverage.[37] Foreign pensions are subject to WEP.\n\nA special minimum benefit, based on an alternative PIA calculation, is available for some workers with long careers but low earnings. However, it is rarely higher than the regularly-computed PIA and thus few workers qualify for the special minimum benefit. Only 32,000 individuals received the special minimum benefit in 2019.[38]\n\nThe benefits someone is eligible for are potentially so complicated that potential retirees should consult the Social Security Administration directly for advice.

{"instruction": "What are some disadvantages of the way the tax code treats incentive stock options?", "context": "", "response": "There are three primary problems with the way the tax code treats incentive stock options. First, the tax code gives an employee a strong incentive to exercise the options early on, to achieve the tax benefit relating to the special option treatment. This means the tax code encourages young employees to write a check to their employer at a time when their entire financial life is likely to be dependent on that employer. This is the exact opposite of diversification, a key goal of personal financial management. The second issue is that the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is imposed at the time of exercise. This requires a potentially large cash outlay, at a time when the employee is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to meet the burden. So not only does the employee have to pay his or her employer to cover the exercise premium, he or she has to send funds to the Internal Revenue Service as well. Finally, the requirement that an employee terminating employment must exercise within three months of termination date to preserve the tax advantage of the options encourages exercise at a time when the employee may not have sufficient funds, and may be looking at financial uncertainty if he or she does not yet have a new job lined up.

Its loan strategy is influenced by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, as well as environmental and social safeguards.\n\nAs of 2022, the World Bank is run by a president and 25 executive directors, as well as 29 various vice presidents. IBRD and IDA have 189 and 174 member countries, respectively. The U.S., Japan, China, Germany and the U.K. have the most voting power.

Even if you have a system that is pre-wired for solar panels, there is no guarantee it will work right away. This can lead to much frustration and the need to learn more about electrical systems than one may wish. First, a solar controller is needed for all solar-powered systems. Solar controllers regulate the incoming energy, and limit the amount of watts a system can support. Many solar panels come with a solar controller built in, but if you have a system pre-wired with existing solar panels that you are trying to add to there is likely already a solar controller. Adding an additional controller will prevent the new panel from working. If one does not know about solar controllers it can be very difficult to figure out, and may lead to angry overnight Amazon shipments of multimeters to determine what is breaking. However, multiple solar controllers is not the only potential problem. Different solar panel manufacturers have different cord types and connector types, and even within a type of connector there is the idea of “polarity” - the direction a connector needs to be plugged in. This can also lead to internet research, frustration, and more overnight Amazon orders of polarity switching adaptors.

Oligopolies often result from the desire to maximize profits, which can lead to collusion between companies. This reduces competition, increases prices for consumers, and lowers wages for employees.\n\nMany industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, electricity providers, the telecommunications sector, Rail freight markets, food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, and automobile manufacturing.\n\nMost countries have laws outlawing anti-competitive behavior. EU competition law prohibits anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing and manipulating market supply and trade among competitors. In the US, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are tasked with stopping collusion. However, corporations can evade legal consequences through tacit collusion, as collusion can only be proven through actual and direct communication between companies.\n\nIt is possible for oligopolies to develop without collusion and in the presence of fierce competition among market participants. This is a situation similar to perfect competition,[2] where oligopolists have their own market structure.[3] In this situation, each company in the oligopoly has a large share in the industry and plays a pivotal, unique role.[4] With post-socialist economies, oligopolies may be particularly pronounced.

{"instruction": "Why is it so rare to see a unseeded tennis player win a grand slam?", "context": "", "response": "To raise a grand slam trophy, a player has to win 7 consecutive best of 5 set matches and in all likelihood against several top 10 players. Tennis is considered to be a demanding sport both physically and mentally. The players have to be in top shape and be ready to duel out many tough 5 set matches during the course of the slam.  During grand slam matches, players can run anywhere from 3 to 4 miles with most of the movement being lateral. The top players have the distinct advantage that they have large support staff including dedicated physios and massage therapists who can get the player ready for subsequent matches. Besides, the top players have coaches who may have themselves won slams, and thus carry a wealth of experience. Sometimes players also enlist the services of data analysts who can do opponent video/data analysis to determine patterns/preferences of opponents. Such massive support staff carry a lot of payroll that most unseeded players cannot afford. For this reason, though at times we see a qualifier make it through to later stages of a slam, they will rarely ever get past quarter finals let alone win a grand slam.", "category": "creative_writing"}

{"instruction": "Summarize the main milestones of an NBA season", "context": "Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.\n\nDuring the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).\n\nThe NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.[91] The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947,[92] though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983–84.[93] Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players.[91][92][93] Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season.[92][93] Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.\n\nIn February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.\n\nShortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3 pm Eastern Time.[94] After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.\n\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, postseason teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\n\nThe postseason teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.[95][96]", "response": "An NBA season starts with training camp in September, which is followed by preseason during which teams play several exhibition games.

{"instruction": "Extract all the authors named in this paragraph on the controversies about Nobel laureate selections", "context": "From 1901 to 1912, the committee, headed by the conservative Carl David af Wirsén, weighed the literary quality of a work against its contribution towards humanity's struggle 'toward the ideal'. Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Émile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors little read today.[47][49]\n\nThe first prize in 1901, awarded to the French poet Sully Prudhomme, was heavily criticised. Many believed that the acclaimed Russian author Tolstoy should have been awarded the first Nobel prize in literature.[50]\n\nThe choice of philosopher Rudolf Eucken as Nobel laureate in 1908 is widely considered to be one of the worst mistakes in the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature. The main candidates for the prize that year were poet Algernon Swinburne and author Selma Lagerlöf, but the Academy were divided between the candidates and, as a compromise, Eucken, representative of the Academy's interpretation of Nobel's \"ideal direction\", was launched as an alternative candidate that could be agreed upon.[51]\n\nThe choice of Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf as Nobel laureate in 1909 (for the \"lofty idealism, vivid imagination and spiritual perception that characterizes her writings\"[52]) followed fierce debate because of her writing style and subject matter, which broke literary decorums of the time.[53][54]\n\nDuring World War I and its immediate aftermath, the committee adopted a policy of neutrality, favouring writers from non-combatant countries.[47] The pacifistic author Romain Rolland was awarded the prize for 1915. Other years during the war Scandinavian writers were favoured, or the award was postponed.[55]\n\nIn 1931 the prize was awarded posthumously to the poet and former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Erik Axel Karlfeldt, who had died earlier that year. The prize was controversial not just because it was the first and only time the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously, but because the Academy had previously awarded two other Swedish writers of the same literary era, Selma Lagerlöf in 1909 and Verner von Heidenstam in 1916. Internationally it was heavily criticised as few had heard of Karlfeldt.[56]\n\nThe Nobel Prize awarded to Pearl Buck in 1938 is one of the most criticised in the history of the prize. The Academy awarded Buck \"for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces\", referring to acclaimed and popular books published only a few years earlier. But her later work is generally not considered to be of the literary standard of a Nobel laureate.[57]\n\nJohn Steinbeck received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. The selection was heavily criticised, and described as \"one of the Academy's biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper.[58] The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", adding, \"we think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\".[58]\n\nIn 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he wrote declining it, stating that \"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize laureate. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\"[59] Nevertheless he was awarded the prize.[60]\n\nSoviet dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 prize laureate, did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm for fear that the USSR would prevent his return afterwards (his works there were circulated in samizdat—clandestine form).[61] After the Swedish government refused to honour Solzhenitsyn with a public award ceremony and lecture at its Moscow embassy, Solzhenitsyn refused the award altogether, commenting that the conditions set by the Swedes (who preferred a private ceremony) were \"an insult to the Nobel Prize itself.\" Solzhenitsyn did not accept the award and prize money until 10 December 1974, after he was deported from the Soviet Union.[62] Within the Swedish Academy, member Artur Lundkvist had argued that the Nobel Prize in Literature should not become a political prize and questioned the artistic value of Solzhenitsyn's work.[63]\n\nIn 1974, Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, and Saul Bellow were believed to be likely candidates for the prize but the Academy decided on a joint award for Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, both members of the Swedish Academy at the time,[64] and unknown outside their home country.[65][66] Bellow received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976; neither Greene nor Nabokov was awarded it.[67]", "response": "- Leo Tolstoy\n- Henrik Ibsen\n- Émile Zola\n- Mark Twain\n- Sully Prudhomme\n- Rudolf Eucken\n- Algernon Swinburne\n- Selma Lagerlöf\n- Romain Rolland\n- Erik Axel Karlfeldt\n- Verner von Heidenstam\n- Pearl Buck\n- John Steinbeck\n- Jean-Paul Sartre\n- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\n- Graham Greene\n- Vladimir Nabokov\n- Saul Bellow\n- Eyvind Johnson\n- Harry Martinson", "category": "information_extraction"}

Instead, the focus is on producing a solution that can generate useful predictions. Machine Learning accepts among others a \"black box\" type approach to data exploration or knowledge discovery and uses not only the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, but also such techniques as Neural Networks which can generate valid predictions but are not capable of identifying the specific nature of the interrelations between the variables on which the predictions are based.", "category": "open_qa"}

The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material.

Both individual and team metrics are considered when determining the best quarterback. Key individual metrics include individual passing metrics (such as passer rating, number of passing yards, and number of touchdowns thrown) and individual awards won (such as the Heisman trophy). Key team metrics include the team's win percentage with the individual as the starting quarterback and the number of conference and nation championships won. A quarterback that excels at passing the football and running the football is commonly referred to as a \"dual threat\" quarterback. Individual rushing statistics may also be considered when determining their rankings.

Take a shovel and dig one blade length into the soil and set that to the side. Then dig out a second blade length into the soil and set this portion to the side as well. Put the first portion back into the hole you've dug and then place the second portion on the top. By following this method, you can exchange the subsoil and topsoil. Alternatively, you can build a raised garden bed using wood or other material you have hand like corrugated metal. A raised garden bed should have sides that are about 1 - 3 feet high although you can vary this based on your needs. Fill the garden bed with soil mix from your local garden store or from other areas of your yard. Once the garden bed is filled, you can begin planting. Finally, you can use a sheet mulching method to start a garden bed in your backyard. Take thick cardboard or several sheets of a heavy paper material and lay it down on top of a grassy area in your backyard.

Since then, poverty has been cut in half at record speed. Enrolment in primary school is now nearly universal. Hundreds of thousands of women have entered the workforce. Steady progress has been made on maternal and child health. And the country is better buttressed against the destructive forces posed by climate change and natural disasters. Bangladesh's success comprises many moving parts—from investing in human capital to establishing macroeconomic stability. Building on this success, the country is now setting the stage for further economic growth and job creation by ramping up investments in energy, inland connectivity, urban projects, and transport infrastructure, as well as prioritizing climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness on its path toward sustainable growth\".[330]\n\nAfter the partition of India, the region underwent a change in economic geography. In East Pakistan, free market principles were generally accepted. The government promoted industrialization to produce consumer goods as quickly as possible in order to avoid dependence on imports. Certain sectors, like public utilities, fell under state ownership.[331] Demand for jute during the Korean War led to the creation of the Adamjee Jute Mills,[332] which replaced jute mills in Dundee and Calcutta as the largest jute mill in the world. However, by the 1960s, East Pakistan's share of exports fell from 70% to 50% as West Pakistan received the major portion of investments. Economic grievances played a key role in the pro-independence aspirations of East Pakistanis. During the initial five years of independence (1971-1975), newly created Bangladesh followed a socialist economy. In the late 1970s, socialist policies were largely reversed, industrial plants were returned to private owners, and private industry was increasingly promoted. The government set up export processing zones to stimulate the export economy. Between 1991 and 1993, finance minister Saifur Rahman launched further reforms with support from the IMF which liberalized the economy and boosted industrial growth, services, and exports.[333] By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the reform momentum lost steam due to chronic political instability, but the economy continued to grow.\n\nIn 2022, Bangladesh had the second largest foreign-exchange reserves in South Asia. The reserves have boosted the government's spending capacity in spite of tax revenues forming only 7.7% of government revenue.[334] A big chunk of investments have gone into the power sector. In 2009, Bangladesh was experiencing daily blackouts several times a day. In 2022, the country achieved 100% electrification.[335][336][337] One of the major anti-poverty schemes of the Bangladeshi government is the Ashrayan Project which aims to eradicate homelessness by providing free housing.[338] The poverty rate has gone down from 80% in 1971,[339] to 44.2% in 1991,[340] to 12.9% in 2021.[341] The literacy rate stood at 74.66% in 2022.[342] Bangladesh has a labor force of roughly 70 million,[343] which is the world's seventh-largest; with an unemployment rate of 5.2% as of 2021.[344] The government is setting up 100 special economic zones to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and generate 10 million jobs.[345] The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) have been established to help investors in setting up factories; and to complement the longstanding Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority (BEPZA).

The basis of the case was that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed for the appointed to request a court order to grant their appointments with original jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court. John Marshall saw that siding with Jefferson would make it seem like the Supreme Court was his lackey.  If they sided with Adams, there was no way to make Jefferson enforce the ruling.

The syndrome is no longer recognised as a diagnosis in itself, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were merged into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others' gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favourite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013 the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that 'treatment' of any form of autism should not be a goal, since autism is not 'a disease that can be removed or cured'. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, 'management of autism itself is chiefly about the provision of the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world'. The effectiveness of particular interventions for autism is supported by only limited data. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety.

When the Spanish authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bolívar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish American wars of independence.\n\nBolívar began his military career in 1810 as a militia officer in the Venezuelan War of Independence, fighting Royalist forces for the first and second Venezuelan republics and the United Provinces of New Granada. After Spanish forces subdued New Granada in 1815, Bolívar was forced into exile on Jamaica. In Haiti, Bolívar met and befriended Haitian revolutionary leader Alexandre Pétion. After promising to abolish slavery in Spanish America, Bolívar received military support from Pétion and returned to Venezuela. He established a third republic in 1817 and then crossed the Andes to liberate New Granada in 1819. Bolívar and his allies defeated the Spanish in New Granada in 1819, Venezuela and Panama in 1821, Ecuador in 1822, Peru in 1824, and Bolivia in 1825. Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, and Panama were merged into the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia), with Bolívar as president there and in Peru and Bolivia.\n\nIn his final years, Bolívar became increasingly disillusioned with the South American republics, and distanced from them because of his centralist ideology. He was successively removed from his offices until he resigned the presidency of Colombia and died of tuberculosis in 1830. His legacy is diverse and far-reaching within Latin America and beyond. He is regarded as a national and cultural icon throughout Latin America; the nations of Bolivia and Venezuela (as the Boliviarian Republic of Venezuela) are named after him, and he has been memorialized all over the world in the form of public art or street names and in popular culture.", "category": "information_extraction"}

It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.[1]\n\nThe thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer William Rankine in 1850 with the names thermodynamic function and heat-potential.[2] In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as transformation-content, in German Verwandlungsinhalt, and later coined the term entropy from a Greek word for transformation. Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning disgregation.[3]\n\nA consequence of entropy is that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.\n\nAustrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI).\n\nIn 1948, Bell Labs scientist Claude Shannon developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. Upon John von Neumann's suggestion, Shannon named this entity of missing information in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as entropy, and gave birth to the field of information theory. This description has been identified as a universal definition of the concept of entropy.[4]", "category": "information_extraction"}

Along with Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, Singapore is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and has surpassed its peers in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Between 1965 and 1995, growth rates averaged around 6 per cent per annum, transforming the living standards of the population.[222]\n\nThe Singaporean economy is regarded as free,[223] innovative,[224] dynamic[225] and business-friendly.[226] For several years, Singapore has been one of the few[227] countries with an AAA credit rating from the big three, and the only Asian country to achieve this rating.[228] Singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zero-tolerance against corruption.[229] It is the world's most competitive economy in 2019, according to the World Economic Forum's ranking of 141 countries,[230] with the 2nd highest GDP per capita.[231][232] Roughly 44 percent of the Singaporean workforce is made up of non-Singaporeans.[233] Despite market freedom, Singapore's government operations have a significant stake in the economy, contributing 22% of the GDP.[234] The city is a popular location for conferences and events.[235]\n\nThe currency of Singapore is the Singapore dollar (SGD or S$), issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).[236] It has been interchangeable with the Brunei dollar at par value since 1967.[237] MAS manages its monetary policy by allowing the Singapore dollar exchange rate to rise or fall within an undisclosed trading band. This is different from most central banks, which use interest rates to manage policy.[238] Singapore has the world's eleventh largest foreign reserves,[239] and one of the highest net international investment position per capita.[240][241]\n\nSingapore has been identified as a tax haven[242] for the wealthy due to its low tax rates on personal income and tax exemptions on foreign-based income and capital gains. Individuals such as Australian millionaire retailer Brett Blundy and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore.[243] In 2009, Singapore was removed from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \"liste grise\" of tax havens,[244] and ranked fourth on the Tax Justice Network's 2015 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's off-shore financial service providers, banking one-eighth of the world's offshore capital, while \"providing numerous tax avoidance and evasion opportunities\".[245] In August 2016, The Straits Times reported that Indonesia had decided to create tax havens on two islands near Singapore to bring Indonesian capital back into the tax base.[246] In October 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore admonished and fined UBS and DBS and withdrew Falcon Private Bank's banking licence for their alleged role in the Malaysian Sovereign Fund scandal.[247][248]\n\n\nPanoramic view of the Central Business District\nSingapore has the world's highest percentage of millionaires, with one out of every six households having at least one million US dollars in disposable wealth. This excludes property, businesses, and luxury goods, which if included would increase the number of millionaires, especially as property in Singapore is among the world's most expensive.[249] In 2016, Singapore was rated the world's most expensive city for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit,[250][251] and this remained true in 2018.[252] The government provides numerous assistance programmes to the homeless and needy through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, so acute poverty is rare.

{"instruction": "What do the terms direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) mean?", "context": "The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.  If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "response": "In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC).

{"instruction": "Summarize the history of NATO", "context": "The Treaty of Dunkirk was signed by France and the United Kingdom on 4 March 1947, during the aftermath of World War II and the start of the Cold War, as a Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance in the event of possible attacks by Germany or the Soviet Union. In March 1948, this alliance was expanded in the Treaty of Brussels to include the Benelux countries, forming the Brussels Treaty Organization, commonly known as the Western Union.[11] Talks for a wider military alliance, which could include North America, also began that month in the United States, where their foreign policy under the Truman Doctrine promoted international solidarity against actions they saw as communist aggression, such as the February 1948 coup d'état in Czechoslovakia. These talks resulted in the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 by the member states of the Western Union plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.[12] Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson was a key author and drafter of the treaty.[13][14][15]\n\nA long rectangular room with multiple rows of seated individuals on each side, and flags hanging at the far end.\nWest Germany joined NATO in 1955, which led to the formation of the rival Warsaw Pact during the Cold War.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty was largely dormant until the Korean War initiated the establishment of NATO to implement it with an integrated military structure. This included the formation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in 1951, which adopted many of the Western Union's military structures and plans,[16] including their agreements on standardizing equipment and agreements on stationing foreign military forces in European countries. In 1952, the post of Secretary General of NATO was established as the organization's chief civilian. That year also saw the first major NATO maritime exercises, Exercise Mainbrace and the accession of Greece and Turkey to the organization.[17][18] Following the London and Paris Conferences, West Germany was permitted to rearm militarily, as they joined NATO in May 1955, which was, in turn, a major factor in the creation of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War.[19]\n\nThe building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 marked a height in Cold War tensions, when 400,000 US troops were stationed in Europe.[20] Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion – doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966.[21][22] In 1982, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance.[23]\n\nThe Revolutions of 1989 in Europe led to a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and focus on the continent. In October 1990, East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance, and in November 1990, the alliance signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) in Paris with the Soviet Union. It mandated specific military reductions across the continent, which continued after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in February 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that December, which removed the de facto main adversaries of NATO.[24] This began a draw-down of military spending and equipment in Europe. The CFE treaty allowed signatories to remove 52,000 pieces of conventional armaments in the following sixteen years,[25] and allowed military spending by NATO's European members to decline by 28 percent from 1990 to 2015.[26] In 1990 assurances were given by several Western leaders to Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand further east, as revealed by memoranda of private conversations.[27][28][29][30] However, the final text of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, signed later that year, contained no mention of the issue of eastward expansion.\n\nTwo tall concrete sections of a wall in a grass lawn in front of a curved building with blue-glass windows.\nThe Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked a turning point in NATO's role in Europe, and this section of the wall is now displayed outside NATO headquarters.\nIn the 1990s, the organization extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.[31] During the Breakup of Yugoslavia, the organization conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999.[32] These conflicts motivated a major post-Cold War military restructuring. NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established.\n\nPolitically, the organization sought better relations with the newly autonomous Central and Eastern European states, and diplomatic forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbours were set up during this post-Cold War period, including the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative in 1994, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997, and the NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council in 1998. At the 1999 Washington summit, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic officially joined NATO, and the organization also issued new guidelines for membership with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\". These plans governed the subsequent addition of new alliance members.[33] The election of French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 led to a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.[22][34][35]\n\nArticle 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks,[36] after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations,[37] and in 2011 enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1973.\n\nRussia's annexation of Crimea led to strong condemnation by all NATO members,[38] and was one of the seven times that Article 4, which calls for consultation among NATO members, has been invoked. Prior times included during the Iraq War and Syrian Civil War.[39] At the 2014 Wales summit, the leaders of NATO's member states formally committed for the first time to spend the equivalent of at least two percent of their gross domestic products on defence by 2024, which had previously been only an informal guideline.[40] At the 2016 Warsaw summit, NATO countries agreed on the creation of NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, which deployed four multinational battalion-sized battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.[41] Before and during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, several NATO countries sent ground troops, warships and fighter aircraft to reinforce the alliance's eastern flank, and multiple countries again invoked Article 4.[42][43][44] In March 2022, NATO leaders met at Brussels for an extraordinary summit which also involved Group of Seven and European Union leaders.[45] NATO member states agreed to establish four additional battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia,[41] and elements of the NATO Response Force were activated for the first time in NATO's history.[46]\n\nAs of June 2022, NATO had deployed 40,000 troops along its 2,500-kilometre-long (1,550 mi) Eastern flank to deter Russian aggression. More than half of this number have been deployed in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, which five countries muster a considerable combined ex-NATO force of 259,000 troops. To supplement Bulgaria's Air Force, Spain sent Eurofighter Typhoons, the Netherlands sent eight F-35 attack aircraft, and additional French and US attack aircraft would arrive soon as well.[47]\n\nNATO enjoys public support across its member states.[48]", "response": "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO, French: Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique nord), or North Atlantic Alliance, the Atlantic Alliance, the Western Alliance, is a military alliance.

{"instruction": "When and why was the plaxton coach production halted?", "context": "By 1936 the company felt justified in constructing a large new manufacturing facility in Seamer Road, Scarborough. This allowed increased production, and Plaxtons became popular with many independent operators throughout Northern England. Many of these operators purchased their vehicles through independent dealers, rather than directly from the factory. In this regard, Plaxton's sales were through Lancashire Motor Traders Ltd of Manchester and Arlington Motor Co Ltd of London. The company became known as FW Plaxton & Son by 1937, as the founder's son, also named Frederick William joined the company at the age of 18. FW Plaxton junior was to be known as Eric to avoid confusion with his father.\n\nPlaxtons built a number of different coach designs through the 1930s, until settling on a distinctive house style. The style typically consisted of a very rounded front profile at the windscreen area with side windows that sloped backwards at the front, were upright at the centre, and sloped forward at the back. Bodywork for the Bedford WTB chassis was particularly distinctive, sloping severally from the bottom of the front wheel arch to the roofline, leaving the \"bullnose\" radiator grille protruding. The rear also sloped prominently. The WTB chassis was very popular choice for operators at that time, together with the Dodge RBF and SBF. Leyland and AEC chassis were also popular for larger coaches, notably the Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal.\n\nOn the outbreak of World War II in 1939, coach production halted and the factory was turned into a munitions factory under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Many records from the early years were lost when an incendiary bomb set fire to the Seamer Road factory in 1943, causing much damage. As the factory was under control of the Ministry of Works, production continued in the open air whilst a replacement was constructed.

{"instruction": "How do you increase your output on a Peloton ride?", "context": "", "response": "If you want to increase your output on a Peloton ride there are definitely a few tips and tricks to follow to ensure progress. First off, I would always recommend using the same official Peloton equipment (Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+) to ensure you are tracking consistent metrics between your rides. I would also recommend doing a Functional Threshold Power Test (FTP Test), to get a baseline of your maximum performance as well as get a power meter for each of your rides. From there, a big amount of increasing your power comes from consistency of both riding frequency as well as consistency in overloading your leg muscles during those durations. Taking Power Zone rides (PZE, PZ, PZMax) or Power Zone programs is a great way to increase your output over time. These rides/programs are tailored to your max level of effort, and as you progress over time, so will your 7 power zone levels. Besides consistently riding and keeping track of your metrics/FTP, there is a quick trick for increasing your output which is not that sustainable. The trick is to ride out of the saddle and crank the resistance all the way up (75+). If you can move your legs at 50+ cadence and over say an 80 resistance, you will be putting up over 300 output. If you can sustain that for a minute at a time and do that 3-5 times during a ride, you will easily increase your total output. Lower cadence is not ideal for increasing your power from a longevity strategy, but is a quick answer for breaking a personal record. Good luck on your future rides, and don't forget to send love with some highfives!", "category": "open_qa"}

As such uncontacted peoples are understood not as living in an anachronistic state of nature but rather as contemporaries of modernity.\n\nA 2009 United Nations report also classified \"peoples in initial contact\" as sharing the same characteristics but beginning to regularly communicate with and integrate into mainstream society.\n\nTo highlight their agency in staying uncontacted or isolated, international organizations emphasize calling them \"indigenous peoples in isolation\" or \"in voluntary isolation\". Otherwise they have also been called \"hidden peoples\" or \"uncontacted tribes\".\n\nHistorically European colonial ideas of uncontacted peoples, and their colonial claims over them, were informed by the imagination of and search for Prester John, king of a wealthy Christian realm in isolation, as well as the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying uncontacted peoples as \"lost tribes\".\n\nInternational organizations have highlighted the importance of protecting indigenous peoples' environment and lands, the importance of protecting them from exploitation or abuse, and the importance of no contact in order to prevent the spread of modern diseases.\n\nHistoric exploitation and abuse at the hands of the majority group have led many governments to give uncontacted people their lands and legal protection. Many indigenous groups live on national forests or protected grounds, such as the Vale do Javari in Brazil or the North Sentinel Island in India.\n\nMuch of the contention over uncontacted peoples has stemmed from governments' desire to extract natural resources. In the 1960s and 1970s, Brazil's federal government attempted to assimilate and integrate native groups living in the Amazon jungle in order to use their lands for farming. Their efforts were met with mixed success and criticism until, in 1987, Brazil created the Department of Isolated Indians inside of FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Índio), Brazil's Indian Agency. FUNAI was successful in securing protected lands which have allowed certain groups to remain relatively uncontacted until the present day.\n\nA different outcome occurred in Colombia when the Nukak tribe of indigenous people was contacted by an evangelical group. The tribe was receptive to trade and eventually moved in order to have closer contact with settlers. This led to an outbreak of respiratory infections, violent clashes with narco-traffickers, and the death of hundreds of the Nukak, more than half of the tribe. Eventually, the Colombian government forcibly relocated the tribe to a nearby town where they received food and government support but were reported as living in poverty.\n\nThe threats to the Nukak tribe are generally shared by all peoples in isolation, particularly the outside world's desire to exploit their lands. This can include lumbering, ranching and farming, land speculation, oil prospecting and mining, and poaching. For example, then Peruvian President Alan García claimed in 2007 that uncontacted groups were only a \"fabrication of environmentalists bent on halting oil and gas exploration\". As recently as 2016, a Chinese subsidiary mining company in Bolivia ignored signs that they were encroaching on uncontacted tribes, and attempted to cover it up. In addition to commercial pursuits, other people such as missionaries can inadvertently cause great damage.\n\nIt was those threats, combined with attacks on their tribe by illegal cocaine traffickers, that led a group of Acre Indians to make contact with a village in Brazil and subsequently with the federal government in 2014. This behaviour suggests that many tribes are aware of the outside world and choose not to make contact unless motivated by fear or self-interest. Satellite images suggest that some tribes intentionally migrate away from roads or logging operations in order to remain secluded.\n\nIndigenous rights activists have often advocated that indigenous peoples in isolation be left alone, saying that contact will interfere with their right to self-determination as peoples. On the other hand, experience in Brazil suggests isolating peoples might want to have trading relationships and positive social connections with others, but choose isolation out of fear of conflict or exploitation. The Brazilian state organization National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) in collaboration with anthropological experts has chosen to make controlled initial contact with tribes. The organization operates 15 trading posts throughout protected territory where tribes can trade for metal tools and cooking instruments. The organization also steps in to prevent some conflicts and deliver vaccinations. However, FUNAI has been critical of political will in Brazil, reporting that it only received 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, after consensus among field agents, FUNAI released videos and images of several tribes under their protection. Although the decision was criticized, the director of the Isolated Indian department, Bruno Pereira, responded that \"The more the public knows and the more debate around the issue, the greater the chance of protecting isolated Indians and their lands\". He shared that the organization has been facing mounting political pressure to open up lands to commercial companies. He also justified the photography by explaining that FUNAI was investigating a possible massacre against the Flechieros tribe.\n\nRecognizing the myriad problems with contact, the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2009 and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2013 introduced guidelines and recommendations that included a right to choose self-isolation.\n\nThere have been reports of human safaris in India's Andaman Islands and in Peru, where tourism companies attempt to help tourists see uncontacted or recently contacted peoples. This practice is controversial.", "category": "information_extraction"}

Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.[117][118]\n\nWidely referred to as Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.[28] The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.[28]\n\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.[119] This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.[120]\n\n\nExpansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties.[28] These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.[121] After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury.[122] The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs,[123] and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season.[124] The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100 million.[125] Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.[126] The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until at least 2024.[127][128] From the start of the 2010–11 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end.[129] The capacity of the Emirates now stands at 60,704.[130]", "response": "{\n  \"Stadiums\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Plumstead Common\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Manor Ground\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Invicta Ground\",\n      \"year\": \"1890\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Manor Ground\",\n      \"year\": \"1893\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Arsenal Stadium\",\n      \"year\": \"1913\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Emirates Stadium\",\n      \"year\": \"2006\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "category": "information_extraction"}

For true Texas brisket all you need is salt, pepper, smoke and time!\n\n1. Purchase a whole packer brisket with both the point and flat muscle included. Prime grade brisket is ideal as it will have more fat marbling, which means more flavor and juiciness. However, choice grade will work fine for most cooks. Plan on 1/2 lb per person.\n\n2. Trim your brisket to remove and hard pieces of fat that will not render in the cooking process. I recommend leaving about 1/4 inch of fat on the point side, and trim off all fat off the flat. Note: the brisket trimming make great fat to mix into burgers!\n\n3. Texas brisket is seasoned only with coarse salt and coarse black pepper. I prefer a 50/50 mix. There are MANY brisket rubs available if you are looking to spice up your brisket from the traditional Texas salt and pepper rub.\n\n4. Use a good quality hardwood lump charcoal in your smoker. I use oak as a base wood with a little bit of hickory mixed in. You can use any smoker that can maintain a consistent temperature of 225-250 degrees. I prefer the Big Green Egg, but there are great smokers available from Weber, Traeger, CampChef and many more.\n\n5. Smoke the brisket at 225 degrees until the internal temperature reaches 165-170 degrees. I then remove the brisket, wrap in butcher paper, and return to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 202 degrees.\n\n6. When the brisket reaches 202 degrees, remove from the smoker and REST. DO NOT SKIP THE REST. Resting the brisket allows those hot and bubbly juices to settle into the meat. I prefer resting my brisket in a cooler covered in towels for 2 hours, but can rest as long as 4 hours before serving.\n\n7. When you are ready to serve, I separate the two pieces, flat and point.Slice the flat against the grain for maximum tenderness. Cube the point for burnt ends.\n\n8.

Also, we wanted to be clear about the firm’s north star, which is improved customer experience, efficient and reliable operations with low cost, and minimal environmental impact. \n\nUber’s business model: \n\nValue proposition:  \n\nUber’s value prop is to offer transportation services via internet orderings from the customer. Customers order a transportation service via a mobile-enabled app and get instant or real-time updates about the order status. This significantly differs from the current taxi-cab model, where customers must hire a taxi-cab by waiting in line at the airport or taxi station. The existing taxi hire model has a poor experience for customers and comes with a high cost. \n\nActivities, resources, and capabilities: \n\nThe critical activity for Uber in this business model is to connect the passengers and drivers on a demand basis concerning a location with a computer algorithm and deliver the service over a mobile app for both drivers and passengers. \n\nUber needs computational resources and engineers to build the algorithm. Also, Uber needs to develop capabilities to attract drivers and passengers to its platform for each market, country, and city. \n\nRevenue model: \n\nIn this model, Uber customers will pay per hire, which will include the transportation charge, driver’s labor fees, and the driver’s car maintenance, including fuel and running and maintenance expenses of the car, and a small commission for Uber that will be the revenue for the company. On average per ride, Uber expects to earn a 3% commission for basic taxi-hire service. Top-of-the-line services like Uber-X may earn up to 10% commission. \n\nScope of the enterprise: \n\nThis business model's primary customer segment is millennials with smartphones with internet-enabled services. \n\n \n\nThis business model's horizontal scope can be vastly expanded to different products. Uber can start with a standard taxi-hire service, and for the luxury segment, it can offer Uber-X and Uber-SUV. Uber can also branch to adjacent industries like food delivery with Uber Eats and freight delivery with Uber Freight. \n\n \n\nThe business’s sheer scope is to develop the in-house demand algorithm for connecting drivers and passengers. Uber does not intend to employ drivers. Instead, it will lease/contract the drivers on a per-ride basis and pay the contract cost to the drivers. In contrast, the computational and other IT infrastructure services will be leased/rented on services like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. This will enable Uber to be agile and move fast in various markets while protecting its intellectual property, the algorithm.", "category": "creative_writing"}

Huberman is an American neuroscientist and tenured associate professor in the department of neurobiology and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine who has made contributions to the brain development, brain plasticity, and neural regeneration and repair fields. Much of his work is focused on the visual system, including the mechanisms controlling light-mediated activation of the circadian and autonomic arousal centers in the brain, as well as brain control over conscious vision or sight.[1][2][better source needed] Huberman has been credited with coining the term \"Non-Sleep Deep Rest\" (NSDR), which he earlier referred to as Yog Nindra, which is to practices that place the brain and body into shallow sleep to accelerate neuroplasticity and help offset mental and physical fatigue.[3][4][5][better source needed]\n\nGraduate and postdoctoral research\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Huberman worked in the laboratory of Irving Zucker, as well as working with Marc Breedlove, at University of California, Berkeley, as part of a team that defined how early androgen exposure impacts development,[7] and he performed the first experiments defining the structure of binocular visual pathways that set the circadian clock in the hypothalamus.[8] From 2000 to 2004, working as a PhD student in the laboratory of Barbara Chapman at the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California, Davis, Huberman discovered that neural activity and axon guidance molecules work in concert to ensure proper wiring of binocular maps in the brain.[9][10][11] Huberman was a Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellow researcher in the laboratory of Ben A. Barres from 2005 to 2010.[12]\n\nHuberman was an assistant professor of neurobiology and neuroscience at University of California, San Diego, from 2011 to 2015. His lab pioneered using genetic tools to study the visual system function, development and disease.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Among the Huberman Lab's discoveries was the finding that specific types of retinal neurons degenerate early in glaucoma[19] a common blinding disease depleting sight in over 70 million people, for which there is no cure.\n\nAfter moving to Stanford in 2016, Huberman discovered and published[20] the use of non-invasive methods such as visual stimulation to enhance regeneration of damaged retinal neurons, leading to partial recovery from blindness, especially when the stimulation is paired with specific forms of gene therapy. The work was covered extensively in the popular press, including Time magazine and Scientific American and is part of the National Eye Institute's Audacious Goals Initiative to restore vision to the blind[citation needed]. The Huberman Lab extended those findings to develop a human clinical trial using virtual reality technology to stimulate regeneration and plasticity of damaged retinal and other visual system neurons.[21]\n\nIn 2017, the Huberman Lab created a virtual reality platform for probing the neural mechanisms underlying pathological fear and anxiety. That work involved collecting 360-degree video of various fear-inducing scenarios such as heights and claustrophobia as well as atypical fear-inducing situations such as swimming with great white sharks. The Huberman VR platform is aimed at making discoveries that will lead to developing new tools for humans to adjust their state in order to promote adaptive coping with stress. The first installment of that work was published in Current Biology, in 2021[22] as a collaboration with neurosurgeon and neuroscientist Edward Chang (UCSF), wherein they reported that specific patterns of insular cortex brain activity correlate with and may predict anxiety responses.[23]\n\nIn May, 2018, Huberman Laboratory published an article[24] in the journal Nature reporting its discovery of two new mammalian brain circuits: one that promotes fear and paralysis, and another that promotes \"courageous\"/confrontational reaction, to visually-evoked threats. That discovery prompted the now ongoing exploration of how these brain regions may be involved in humans suffering from anxiety-related disorders such as phobias and generalized anxiety.[25]\n\nIn 2020, Huberman initiated a collaboration with the laboratory of David Spiegel in the Stanford Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, to systematically study how particular patterns of respiration (i.e., breathing/breathwork) and the visual system influence the autonomic nervous system, stress, and other brain states, including sleep.[26][27][28]\n\nIn 2021, Huberman launched the \"Huberman Lab\" podcast with the goal of translating neuroscience into tools that can be applied in everyday life.

For many skiers their first memories of skiing are as a kid with their parents, and brings forward fond childhood memories of snow days, hot chocolate and being outdoors.  But what makes skiing so wonderful is that is blends both individual pursuits and as a group activity.  It is a fun activity to do with a group where all the participants are experiencing the outdoors and the trails together.  At the same time, each skier is dependent on their own skills to get down the trail, thereby providing the individual to have their own challenges and experience while spending time with friends or family.  \n\nSkiing offers the opportunity to enjoy the natural wonders of the mountains and experience breathtaking views.  Every day brings different conditions the skier has to adjust to; visibility, temperature, snow conditions.

{"instruction": "What should I do to maximize my chances of getting into a top business school?", "context": "", "response": "There are many controllable factors that can help improve your chances of attending a top business school such as Harvard, Stanford, or Wharton.  Four of the most important include:\n- Track record of impactful work experience\n- Strong letters of recommendation from your supervisors\n- Excellent GMAT score and, to a lesser extent, GPA\n- Compelling essays \n\nWork experience is often cited as the most important factor for business school admissions.  Candidates should look for jobs that involve building best-in-class business skills (such as working at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey) or involve leading large groups of people to accomplish important and challenging projects.  One piece of advice is to look at the resumes of successful applicants and see what types of roles they had pre-MBA.\n\nIn addition to having excellent work experience on your resume, it is equally important to have a track record of success at those jobs.  To evaluate track record of strong work performance, business schools require 2-3 letters of recommendations.  It is critical for these recommendations to be highly positive, and any lack of enthusiasm can be an instant red flag for admissions officers.\n\nIn terms of quantitative factors, Harvard, Stanford and Wharton have high average GMAT scores.  Harvard's median GMAT score, for example, was 730 out of 800 for the class of 2024.  Be sure to invest time in preparing for the GMAT, as candidates can significantly increase scores through consistent and dedicated practice.\n\nAdditionally, the essays candidates submit are very important.  The goal of a business school admissions officer to is find candidates who are likely to reach senior executive leadership or other impactful roles in society.  Your essay would ideally reflect a) an aspirational but attainable goal to reach a high impact position, and b) a clear path to get from where you currently are to your long-term goals, including a logical short-term goal immediate post-business school.\n\nSome candidates opt to hire an MBA admissions consultant, which typically costs between $2000-3000 per application.  Consider whether an MBA admissions consultant would be valuable for your process, and if so, be sure to evaluate several by having free upfront consultations.", "category": "general_qa"}

One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.[10][11][12][13]\n\nPicasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\n\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.", "response": "Blue Period (1901–1904)\nRose Period (1904–1906)\nAfrican-influenced Period (1907–1909)\nAnalytic Cubism (1909–1912)\nSynthetic Cubism or Crystal Period (1912–1919)\nSurrealism (mid-1920s)", "category": "information_extraction"}
{"instruction": "From the text provided, give me a summary of the most popular attractions in Yosemite National Park.", "context": "Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, is one of the most popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise 3,000 and 4,800 feet (910 and 1,460 m), respectively, above the valley floor. The park contains dozens of other granite domes.[80]\n\nThe high country of Yosemite contains beautiful areas such as Tuolumne Meadows, Dana Meadows, the Clark Range, the Cathedral Range, and the Kuna Crest. The Sierra crest and the Pacific Crest Trail run through Yosemite, with peaks of red metamorphic rock, such as Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, and granite peaks, such as Mount Conness. Mount Lyell is the highest point in the park, standing at 13,120 feet (4,000 m). The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite National Park and is one of the few remaining in the Sierra Nevada.[81]\n\nThe park has three groves of ancient giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the Tuolumne Grove (25 trees), and the Merced Grove (20 trees).[82] This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived.[83]\n\nWater and ice\n\nThe Merced River flowing through Yosemite Valley, a U-shaped valley\nThe Tuolumne and Merced River systems originate along the crest of the Sierra Nevada in the park and have carved river canyons 3,000 to 4,000 feet (910 to 1,220 m) deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately 680 square miles (1,800 km2). The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately 511 square miles (1,320 km2).[84]\n\nHydrologic processes, including glaciation, flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating landforms in the park.[84] The park also contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m2), two reservoirs, and 1,700 miles (2,700 km) of streams, all of which help form these two large watersheds.[85] Wetlands in Yosemite occur in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from 3,000 to 11,000 feet (910 to 3,350 m) in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the riparian habitats found on the banks of Yosemite's numerous streams and rivers.[86]\n\n\nBridalveil Fall flows from a U-shaped hanging valley that was created by a tributary glacier.\nYosemite is famous for its high concentration of waterfalls in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and hanging valleys in the park provide many places for waterfalls to exist, especially during April, May, and June (the snowmelt season). Located in Yosemite Valley, the Yosemite Falls is the highest in North America at 2,425 feet (739 m). Also in Yosemite Valley is the much lower volume Ribbon Falls, which has the highest single vertical drop, 1,612 feet (491 m).[83] Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite Valley waterfalls is Bridalveil Fall, which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of ephemeral waterfalls can become active in the park after heavy rains or melting snowpack.[87]\n\nAll glaciers in the park are relatively small glaciers that occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast-facing cirques. Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers 160 acres (65 ha).[88] None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the Ice Age alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the neoglacial episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the Little Ice Age).[82] Many Yosemite glaciers, such as the Black Mountain Glacier that was discovered in 1871 and gone by the mid-1980s, have disappeared.[89] Yosemite's final two glaciers – the Lyell and Maclure glaciers – have receded over the last 100 years and are expected by scientists to eventually disappear as a result of natural melting and climate change.[90][91]", "response": "Although Yosemite National Park is perhaps best known for attractions located in the seven square mile Yosemite Valley, the park is quite large and contains popular attractions ranging from groves of giant sequoias, to glaciers and waterfalls, to dozens of granite domes.

He is best known for his time in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and other combat sports.[9] A member of the UFC Hall of Fame, Shamrock is widely regarded as an icon and pioneer of the sport.[10][11] He has headlined over 15 main events and co-main events in the UFC and Pride FC and set numerous MMA pay-per-view records.[12] In the early part of his UFC career, Shamrock was named \"The World's Most Dangerous Man\" by ABC News in a special called \"The World's Most Dangerous Things\".[13] The moniker has stuck as his nickname.\n\nShamrock became known early on in the UFC for his rivalry with Royce Gracie. After fighting to a draw in the inaugural UFC \"Superfight\", he became the first UFC Superfight Champion when he defeated Dan Severn at UFC 6; the title was eventually replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories were introduced to the UFC.[14] He was also the first foreign MMA champion in Japan, winning the title of King of Pancrase Openweight title. During his reign as the UFC Superfight Champion, he was widely considered the #1 mixed martial artist in the world,[15] and in 2008, Shamrock was ranked by Inside MMA as one of the top 10 greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time.[16] He is the founder of the Lion's Den mixed martial arts training camp, and is the older brother of fellow fighter Frank Shamrock.\n\nIn addition to his mixed martial arts career, Shamrock enjoyed considerable success in professional wrestling, particularly during his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). There, he is a one-time Intercontinental Champion, a one-time World Tag Team Champion and the 1998 King of the Ring. Shamrock also wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling), where he is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion – the first world champion under the TNA banner – and a 2020 inductee in the Impact Hall of Fame. He headlined multiple pay-per-view events in both promotions, including 1997's D-Generation X: In Your House, where he challenged for the WWF Championship. Additionally, Shamrock was also one of the first wrestlers to use the shoot style of wrestling in America, being credited by WWE with popularizing the legitimate ankle lock submission hold.[17]\n\nA \"military brat,\" Kilpatrick was born at Robins Air Force Base, in Warner Robins, Georgia, where he lived for his first four years. His father Richard Kilpatrick was a United States Air Force enlistee, and his mother Diane Kilpatrick was a waitress and dancer who had her first son when she was 15. Shamrock had three brothers and came from a broken family in a predominantly black neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe was often left to fend for himself, and, without his parents' supervision or guidance, got into many fights. His father abandoned his family when Shamrock was five. His mother married an Army aviator named Bob Nance, and the newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent. They continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who fought in the Vietnam War, joined the local fire department and also worked in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved in and excelled at sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.[18]\n\nAt age 10, Shamrock ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. When he was 13, his stepfather kicked him out of their home, and each of the brothers went their own ways. Shamrock lived in cars before being placed in a foster home.[18][19] He went through seven group homes and served time in a juvenile hall. He moved between several more group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14 in Susanville, California where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob's honor.[18]\n\nAt Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in football and wrestling. As a senior, he qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery.[18] He received no scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors' orders, he joined the Shasta College football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season.[18] The San Diego Chargers of the National Football League later offered him a tryout, but he declined in order to pursue a career in professional wrestling, where he debuted in 1989 in the South Atlantic Pro Wrestling promotion.[18]", "response": "Ken Shamrock changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in honor of his adoptive father, Bob Shamrock.

The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner.

For any program f that might determine whether programs halt, a \"pathological\" program g, called with some input, can pass its own source and its input to f and then specifically do the opposite of what f predicts g will do. No f can exist that handles this case. A key part of the proof is a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which is known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines.

He left Wire in 2004, and has since been focusing on solo work and collaborations with visual artists and fellow experimental musicians.\n\nWire released three albums between 1976 and 1979, Pink Flag, Chairs Missing and 154, before temporarily disbanding after a show at London's Electric Ballroom at the start of 1980. At this time, Gilbert formed a series of bands/projects with Wire's bassist, Graham Lewis, including Cupol, Dome, P'o, and Duet Emmo.[1] Gilbert's collaborations with Lewis were experimental, featuring ambient music and found sounds.[7] Dome performed at art galleries with visual displays that allowed audience interactivity. Gilbert and Lewis performed with tubes made of paper over their heads, thus restricting their vision. Artist Russell Mills frequently collaborated with Dome.[8] In 1980, Gilbert and Lewis produced The The's debut single \"Black & White/Controversial Subject\" for 4AD, as well as the single \"Drop/So\" by A.C.

{"instruction": "How would you define electricity based on the following paragraph?", "context": "Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law. Electric potential is typically measured in volts.\nElectricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:\nElectric power where electric current is used to energise equipment;\nElectronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the 17th and 18th centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation.

{"instruction": "What is \"woke\" and why is it so controversial?", "context": "", "response": "Woke is a general political term used to group a set of similar ideologies in an attempt to characterize the political motivations typically ascribed to the far left. Although many definitions of woke exist, these definitions run along a few common threads. Woke is typically used to describe the ideals underpinning what is known as equality of outcome. This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.\n\nThose who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.\n\nWokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism.

American football, also known as gridiron, was first played in 1869 in the United States and mostly known in the United States and Canada. It rivals two teams on a rectangular field. Both teams have an offence as well as a defence formation. The first offence and defence of the match is decided by coin tossed where the winner decide for the first half of the match while the opposite match starts at the half-time mark. The offence team tries to take the oval-shaped ball to the other side of the field by passing or running it at each play. The defence team blocks the offence team so they get the balls themselves either by steeling it or when the offence team hasn’t progressed 10 yards in 4 plays. Then, offence team becomes defence and vice versa. When the offence team successfully reach the 10-yard lines, they obtain a new set of 4 plays to get to the endzone, where they obtain points when succeeding, called a touchdown. They also get points from kicking the ball within the goalpost. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the game. European football, also known as soccer, is a match between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field, known as pitch. Players primarily use their feet to propel a sphere-shaped ball across the field into the rectangular shaped goal guarded by a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player of each team that can use his hands and arms on the ball within a specific region of the field close to their goals. The game is played continuously until a fault is committed or the ball exits the field.

The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).\n\nThe principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.\n\nThe opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.", "response": "- Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding.\n- The object of the game in to score more runs than the opposing team.\n- Runs are score only by the batting team during their at bats.

In 1633, he joined the VOC and sailed to Batavia, now Jakarta, Indonesia. He participated in several voyages, including one to Japan. In 1642, Tasman was appointed by the VOC to lead an expedition to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean. His mission was to discover new trade routes and to establish trade relations with the native inhabitants. After leaving Batavia, Tasman sailed eastward and reached the coast of Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen's Land after his patron. He then sailed north and discovered the west coast of New Zealand, which he named Staten Landt, but later renamed Nieuw Zeeland after the Dutch province of Zeeland.\n\nDespite his achievements, Tasman's expedition was not entirely successful. The encounter with the Māori people on the South Island of New Zealand resulted in a violent confrontation, which left four of Tasman's men dead. He returned to Batavia without having made any significant contact with the native inhabitants or establishing any trade relations. Nonetheless, Tasman's expedition paved the way for further exploration and colonization of Australia and New Zealand by the Europeans. Tasman continued to serve the Dutch East India Company until his death in 1659, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest explorers of his time.\n\nOrigins and early life\n\nPortrait of Abel Tasman, his wife and daughter. Attributed to Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp, 1637 (not authenticated).[1][2]\nAbel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands. The oldest available source mentioning him is dated 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city.\n\nRelocation to the Dutch East Indies\nEmployed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), Tasman sailed from Texel (Netherlands) to Batavia, now Jakarta, in 1633 taking the southern Brouwer Route. While based in Batavia, Tasman took part in a voyage to Seram Island (in what is now the Maluku Province in Indonesia) because the locals had sold spices to other European nationalities than the Dutch. He had a narrow escape from death when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by the inhabitants of the island.[6]\n\nBy August 1637, Tasman was back in Amsterdam, and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to Batavia. On 25 March 1638 he tried to sell his property in the Jordaan, but the purchase was cancelled.\n\nHe was second-in-command of a 1639 expedition of exploration into the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast. The fleet included the ships Engel and Gracht and reached Fort Zeelandia (Dutch Formosa) and Deshima (an artificial island off Nagasaki, Japan).\n\nFirst major voyage\nIn August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of Antonie van Diemen, Cornelis van der Lijn, Joan Maetsuycker, Justus Schouten, Salomon Sweers, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia dispatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage of exploration to little-charted areas east of the Cape of Good Hope, west of Staten Land (near the Cape Horn of South America) and south of the Solomon Islands.[7]\n\nOne of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of \"all the totally unknown\" Provinces of Beach.[8] This was a purported yet non-existent landmass said to have plentiful gold, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century, as a result of an error in some editions of Marco Polo's works.\n\nThe expedition was to use two small ships, Heemskerck and Zeehaen.\n\nMauritius\nIn accordance with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642[9] and arrived at Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal.[10] The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel.\n\nBecause of the prevailing winds, Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island, both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November, snow and hail influenced the ship's council to alter course to a more north-easterly direction,[11] with the intention of having the Solomon Islands as their destination.\n\nTasmania\n\nCoastal cliffs of Tasman Peninsula\nOn 24 November 1642, Tasman reached and sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour.[12] He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land, after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.\n\nProceeding south, Tasman skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. He then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island, but he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named Storm Bay. Two days later, on 1 December, Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. On 2 December, two ship's boats under the command of the Pilot, Major Visscher, rowed through the Marion Narrows into Blackman Bay, and then west to the outflow of Boomer Creek where they gathered some edible \"greens\".[13] Tasman named the bay, Frederick Hendrik Bay, which included the present North Bay, Marion Bay and what is now Blackman Bay. (Tasman's original naming, Frederick Henrick Bay, was mistakenly transferred to its present location by Marion Dufresne in 1772). The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was too rough, a ship's carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.[14]\n\nFor two more days, he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point,[15] he tried to follow the coast line but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait.[16] Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.[17]\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMurderers' Bay, drawing by Isaack Gilsemans[18]\n\nMāori haka\nTasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. The expedition endured a rough voyage and in one of his diary entries Tasman claimed that his compass was the only thing that had kept him alive.\n\nOn 13 December 1642 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island of New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to sight New Zealand.[19] Tasman named it Staten Landt \"in honour of the States General\" (Dutch parliament).[20] He wrote, \"it is possible that this land joins to the Staten Landt but it is uncertain\",[21] referring to Isla de los Estados, a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America, encountered by the Dutch navigator Jacob Le Maire in 1616.[22] However, in 1643 Brouwer's expedition to Valdivia found out that Staaten Landt was separated by sea from the hypothetical Southern Land.[23][24][25] Tasman continued: \"We believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown Southland.\"[26] Tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined Terra Australis that stretched across the Pacific to near the southern tip of South America.[27]\n\nAfter sailing north then east for five days, the expedition anchored about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the coast off what is now Golden Bay. A group of Māori paddled out in a waka (canoe) and attacked some sailors who were rowing between the two Dutch vessels. Four sailors were clubbed to death with patu.[28]\nIn the evening about one hour after sunset we saw many lights on land and four vessels near the shore, two of which betook themselves towards us. When our two boats returned to the ships reporting that they had found not less than thirteen fathoms of water, and with the sinking of the sun (which sank behind the high land) they had been still about half a mile from the shore. After our people had been on board about one glass, people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff, hollow voices. We could not in the least understand any of it; however, when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer. But they did not come nearer than a stone's shot. They also blew many times on an instrument, which produced a sound like the moors' trumpets. We had one of our sailors (who could play somewhat on the trumpet) play some tunes to them in answer.\"[10]\n\nAs Tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore, of which \"eleven swarming with people came off towards us.\" The waka approached the Zeehaen which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag. Canister shot also hit the side of a waka.[10][29] It has been speculated that the local Maori had thought the Dutch were trying to land at a major agricultural area, which the Māori were trying to protect.[30] Tasman named the area \"Murderers' Bay\".[28]\n\nThe expedition then sailed north, sighting Cook Strait, which it mistook for a bight and named \"Zeehaen's Bight\". Two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of New Zealand still endure: Cape Maria van Diemen and Three Kings Islands. (Kaap Pieter Boreels was renamed Cape Egmont by Captain James Cook 125 years later.)\n\nReturn voyage\n\nTongatapu, the main island of Tonga; drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\n\nThe bay of Tongatapu with the two ships; drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\nEn route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of Vanua Levu and Cikobia-i-Lau before making his way back into the open sea.\n\nThe expedition turned north-west towards New Guinea and arrived back in Batavia on 15 June 1643.[14]\n\nSecond major voyage\nTasman left Batavia on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (Limmen, Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of New Holland. However, he missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia, making observations on New Holland and its people.[31] He arrived back in Batavia in August 1644.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although Tasman was received courteously on his return, the company was upset that Tasman had not fully explored the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions.[32] For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans; mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.\n\nLater life\nOn 2 November 1644, Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice in Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now Thailand) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648, he was in charge of an expedition sent to Manila to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649, he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651, he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter. In his will (dating from 1657[33]), he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village, Lutjegast.[34]\n\nAlthough Tasman's pilot, Frans Visscher, published Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land in 1642,[35] Tasman's detailed journal was not published until 1898. Nevertheless, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers.[31] The journal signed by Abel Tasman of the 1642 voyage is held in the Dutch National Archives at The Hague.[36]\n\nLegacy\nTasman's ten-month voyage in 1642–43 had significant consequences. By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman's suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a Terra Australis rising gradually from the waters around Tierra del Fuego. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769.\n\nMultiple places have been named after Tasman, including:\n\nthe Australian island and state of Tasmania, renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen's land. It includes features such as:\nthe Tasman Peninsula.\nthe Tasman Bridge.\nthe Tasman Highway.\nthe Tasman Sea.\n\nin New Zealand:\nthe Tasman Glacier.\nTasman Lake.\nthe Tasman River.\nMount Tasman.\nthe Abel Tasman National Park.\nTasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere.\nthe Tasman District.\nAbel Tasman Monument.", "response": "Sure, here is summary about Abel Janszoon Tasman:\n\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (Dutch: [ˈɑbəl ˈjɑnsoːn ˈtɑsmɑn]; 1603 – 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer and explorer best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).

Other processes are called photomasks and photolithography. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuit in the integrated circuit. Ultraviolet light is used along with a photoresist layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.[4]\n\nThe etching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the photoresist layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called plasma etching. Plasma etching usually involves an etch gas pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create plasma. A common etch gas is chlorofluorocarbon, or more commonly known Freon. A high radio-frequency voltage between the cathode and anode is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The silicon wafer is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The result is silicon that is etched anisotropically.[1][4]\n\nThe last process is called diffusion. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as doping. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the p–n junction. To get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting material is ready to be used in an integrated circuit.[1][4]", "response": "-Thermal oxidation\n-Photomasks/photolithography\n-Etching (mainly plasma etching)\n-Diffusion/doping", "category": "information_extraction"}

The weather is mild all throughout the winter, so you won't need to scrape snow and ice off of your car every day, although there have been a number of snow storms in the last couple years but they quickly melt and only last a day or two at a time. The summers get hot and can stay above 100 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks at a time. This may sound like a negative, but one of the best things about Austin is the access to water. Lady Bird Lake, sometimes called Town Lake, is actually a river that runs through the middle of the city. Paddle boarding, swimming in Barton Springs, and party boats on Lake Travis are all water related activities that are particularly fun for a young demographic. There is a vibrant music scene with many local bands and plenty of art related communities. The conscious community in Austin is growing as well through many different types of activities like ecstatic dance, authentic relating, and tantra. There is something for everyone in Austin. The city is a tourist destination with many bachelor and bachelorette parties choosing to visit. Austin also hosts SXSW and ACL, both of which draw many hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.

{"instruction": "Based on the paragraph below, describe 2 suitable applications of noble gases.", "context": "The noble gases (historically also the inert gases; sometimes referred to as aerogens) make up a class of chemical elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six naturally occurring noble gases are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn).\nOganesson (Og) is a synthetically produced highly radioactive element. Although IUPAC has used the term \"noble gas\" interchangeably with \"group 18\" and thus included oganesson, it may not be significantly chemically noble and is predicted to break the trend and be reactive due to relativistic effects. Because of the extremely short 0.7 ms half-life of its only known isotope, its chemistry has not yet been investigated.\nFor the first six periods of the periodic table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide toxicity.\nThe properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure: Their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be \"full\", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds. The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than 10 °C (18 °F); that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.\nNeon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields that have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over 55 m (180 ft). After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent in the Hindenburg disaster, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.", "response": "The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted.

Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed.

In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs.

Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. \nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology.

Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. \nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.

The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.", "response": "Cricket is a bat and ball game, invented in England.

By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the Great Depression, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader. Carter himself was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have otherwise been valedictorian.

{"instruction": "What factors contributed to the decline of AI research in the 1970s?", "context": "TThe first AI winter 1974–1980\nIn the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared.[101] At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.[102] Despite the difficulties with public perception of AI in the late 70s, new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas.[103]\n\nThe problems\nIn the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve; all the programs were, in some sense, \"toys\".[104] AI researchers had begun to run into several fundamental limits that could not be overcome in the 1970s. Although some of these limits would be conquered in later decades, others still stymie the field to this day.[105]\n\nLimited computer power: There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in memory.[106] Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy.[107] With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS).[108] As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.\nIntractability and the combinatorial explosion. In 1972 Richard Karp (building on Stephen Cook's 1971 theorem) showed there are many problems that can probably only be solved in exponential time (in the size of the inputs). Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires unimaginable amounts of computer time except when the problems are trivial. This almost certainly meant that many of the \"toy\" solutions used by AI would probably never scale up into useful systems.[109]\nCommonsense knowledge and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply enormous amounts of information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.[110]\nMoravec's paradox: Proving theorems and solving geometry problems is comparatively easy for computers, but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult. This helps explain why research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle 1970s.[111]\nThe frame and qualification problems. AI researchers (like John McCarthy) who used logic discovered that they could not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making changes to the structure of logic itself. They developed new logics (like non-monotonic logics and modal logics) to try to solve the problems.[112]\nThe end of funding\nSee also: AI winter\nThe agencies which funded AI research (such as the British government, DARPA and NRC) became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected research into AI. The pattern began as early as 1966 when the ALPAC report appeared criticizing machine translation efforts. After spending 20 million dollars, the NRC ended all support.[113] In 1973, the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in England criticized the utter failure of AI to achieve its \"grandiose objectives\" and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country.[114] (The report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for AI's failings.)[115] DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of three million dollars.[116] By 1974, funding for AI projects was hard to find.\n\nHans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues. \"Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration.\"[117] However, there was another issue: since the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under increasing pressure to fund \"mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research\". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA. Instead, the money was directed at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems.[118]\n\nCritiques from across campus\nSee also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\nSeveral philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas, who argued that Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could.[119] Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little \"symbol processing\" and a great deal of embodied, instinctive, unconscious \"know how\".[120][121] John Searle's Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to \"understand\" the symbols that it uses (a quality called \"intentionality\"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as \"thinking\".[122]\n\nThese critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed so far off the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference \"know how\" or \"intentionality\" made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle \"they misunderstand, and should be ignored.\"[123] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\"[124] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish.[125] Although he was an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, he \"deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being.\"[126]\n\nWeizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote a \"computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue\" based on ELIZA.[127] Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life.[128]\n\nPerceptrons and the attack on connectionism\nA perceptron was a form of neural network introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt, who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science. Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that \"perceptron may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages.\" An active research program into the paradigm was carried out throughout the 1960s but came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert's 1969 book Perceptrons. It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Frank Rosenblatt's predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was devastating: virtually no research at all was done in connectionism for 10 years. Eventually, a new generation of researchers would revive the field and thereafter it would become a vital and useful part of artificial intelligence. Rosenblatt would not live to see this, as he died in a boating accident shortly after the book was published.[102]\n\nLogic and symbolic reasoning: the \"neats\"\nLogic was introduced into AI research as early as 1959, by John McCarthy in his Advice Taker proposal.[129] In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 1960s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems.[130] A more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.[131] Prolog uses a subset of logic (Horn clauses, closely related to \"rules\" and \"production rules\") that permit tractable computation. Rules would continue to be influential, providing a foundation for Edward Feigenbaum's expert systems and the continuing work by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon that would lead to Soar and their unified theories of cognition.[132]\n\nCritics of the logical approach noted, as Dreyfus had, that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason, Eleanor Rosch, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof.[133] McCarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant. He argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.[134]\n\nFrames and scripts: the \"scuffles\"\nAmong the critics of McCarthy's approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like \"story understanding\" and \"object recognition\" that required a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like \"chair\" or \"restaurant\" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that \"using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise.\"[135] Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"scruffy\", as opposed to the \"neat\" paradigms used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.[136]\n\nIn 1975, in a seminal paper, Minsky noted that many of his fellow \"scruffy\" researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be \"logical\", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think. He called these structures \"frames\". Schank used a version of frames he called \"scripts\" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.[137]", "response": "Unrealistic expectations, a lack of funding, the challenge of producing significant results, and the discovery of a number of fundamental limitations that AI scientists could not overcome in the 1970s all contributed to the decline of AI research in that decade", "category": "closed_qa"}

Get this most important tool first.\n- A 1” wide tape measure. Get one that’s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.\n- A small level to evenly hang pictures and anything else you can think of.

A smaller 8” and larger 10” adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood…etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand…you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called Allen keys. You’ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes.

{"instruction": "How to find a boyfriend or girlfriend?", "context": "", "response": "Finding a partner is a life topic. People fall in love in very different ways. Some people will start a relationship with friends after knowing each other for years, while some will love someone who was still a completely stranger yesterday. Some people will completely rely on serendipity to meet someone new, while some use dating apps to find a potential lover with clear purposes. There are no right ways to start a relationship, but a wrong relationship can be harmful to both sides. Therefore, you should take your take and never rush into a new relationship. Some tips for finding a BF or GF:\n1. Participate in more events to meet new people. For example, exercise classes, clubs of your hobby, volunteering, and parties can be a good start.\n2. Ask your friends to recommend some guy/girl they know. Friends can be a reliable source since they share similar background and experience with you.\n3. Be nice, honest and helpful to everyone you meet. This can help you to build good reputation in your friends circle so that people are more likely to be attracted by you.\n4. Know a person well before you start developing a romantic relationship with him/her. Some people may be very different as a friend vs. in a relationship. It's better to spend more time dating, knowing his/her life before making a decision.", "category": "general_qa"}

Well, there are a number of reasons why one might feel this way. Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window — who is to say one’s value is wrong?\n\nEnter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus — rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top — an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because “The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it.

{"instruction": "What is a mitochondrion?", "context": "", "response": "A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\n\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria,[6] and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\n\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 μm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\n\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\n\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\"mitogenome\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy.", "category": "open_qa"}

France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The United States took over the project on May 4, 1904, and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.\n\nCanal locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, and then lower the ships at the other end.

For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \"sa\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic.

This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language.

These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting,[3] decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training.[11][12] These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "response": "Around 2018.", "category": "closed_qa"}

When you say a habit is bad, it actually means the action you take after the trigger event is something you do not want to keep doing.\n\nAn effective way to make changes is to replace the action to something different. To make this alternative action effective, this action will need to also produce the reward that your brain is seeking for. \n\nIn order to find an effective alternative action, you will need to understand what is your trigger and what is the reward. \n\nFiguring out the trigger is the first step. You can try to think about what happened when you started to take actions. One way to find the pattern is to write down what happened. Then, you can look at them to find the pattern. \n\nOnce you find out the trigger, you can try to remind you to change your action after experiencing the trigger event. With your changed action, you will be able to gradually figure out the reward hidden in your old habit. Some actions will not give you the satisfying feeling like old time. After some try-and-error, you can likely tell the new action that actually gives you the same satisfying feeling. Then, you can keep following the new action. Essentially, this new action helps you form the new habit, which suppress the old habit. \n\nFinally, please note that when you are having extra stress, you may find it is harder to follow the new habit and start to worry about picking up the old habit again.

The fourth plane was similarly intended to hit a federal government building in D.C., but crashed in a field following a passenger revolt. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the global war on terror.\n\nThe first impact was that of American Airlines Flight 11. It was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46 a.m. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03,[e] the World Trade Center's South Tower was hit by United Airlines Flight 175. Both 110-story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and forty-one minutes,[f] bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the WTC complex, as well as damaging or destroying various other buildings surrounding the towers. A third flight, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., causing a partial collapse. The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, flew in the direction of Washington, D.C. Alerted to the previous attacks, the plane's passengers attempted to gain control of the aircraft, but the hijackers ultimately crashed the plane in a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, near Shanksville at 10:03 a.m. Investigators determined that Flight 93 target was either the United States Capitol or the White House.\n\nWithin hours of the attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency determined that al-Qaeda was responsible. The United States formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had not complied with U.S. demands to expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite its leader, Osama bin Laden. The U.S.'s invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—its only usage to date—called upon allies to fight al-Qaeda. As U.S. and NATO ground forces swept through Afghanistan, bin Laden fled to the White Mountains, where he narrowly avoided capture by U.S.-led forces.[11] Although bin Laden initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks.[3] Al-Qaeda's cited motivations included U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq.

The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout.[5]", "response": "Soccer is played between two teams of players who pass a spherical inflated ball between each other, predominantly using the feet and head, with the aim of getting the ball into the opponents goal (a rectangular opening at each end of the playing area) .

There are many different reasons that people decide to pursue getting their pilot's license including the challenge of learning a new skill, having the ability to travel by private plane for business or pleasure, sightseeing, or as a career option.  The process of learning to fly and getting your license requires several steps and usually takes about a year to complete.  The first step is to research local flight schools and potentially do a discovery flight with a flight instructor to see if you enjoy it before committing the time and money.  Should you decide to pursue it, you'll need to find and go to an Aviation Medical Examiner to get checked-out and have a student pilot and medical certificate issued.  Once you've completed that you can begin your training which will include both ground school and flight school.  The next step is to purchase the necessary books, study sufficiently and prepare to take an FAA written exam.  While you're studying, you'll begin your flight training which requires a minimum of 40 hours of flying, however most individuals end-up flying between 60 - 75 hours.  When your instructor feels you're able to demonstrate mastery of all of the required skills and are able to make sound decisions, you'll be ready to take a practical exam with either an FAA examiner or a designated examiner.   Upon successful completion of your test, you'll be issued your pilots license and be ready to take up passengers.  On average, the cost to get your pilot's license ranges from $8,000 to $12,000.

{"instruction": "Summarize this paragraph", "context": "High rates of crime and violence in Latin America are undermining growth, threatening human welfare, and impeding social development, according to World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). According to the Financial Times, \"The region registers close to 40 per cent of the world’s murders despite being home to only 9 per cent of the global population. According to Lapop, one in four Latin Americans was assaulted and robbed\" in 2018. Latin America is caught in a vicious circle, where economic growth is thwarted by high crime rates, and insufficient economic opportunity contributes to high crime. Crime and violence thrives as the rule of law is weak, economic opportunity is scarce, and education is poor. Therefore, effectively addressing crime requires a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that addresses its root social, political, and economic causes.\n\nRecent statistics indicate that crime is becoming the biggest problem in Latin America. Amnesty International has declared Latin America as the most dangerous region in the world for journalists to work.\n\nIn Mexico, armed gangs of rival drug smugglers have been fighting it out with one another, thus creating new hazards in rural areas. Crime is extremely high in all of the major cities in Brazil. Wealthy citizens have had to provide for their own security. In large parts of Rio de Janeiro, armed criminal gangs are said to be in control. Crime statistics were high in El Salvador, Guatemala and Venezuela during 1996. The police have not been able to handle the work load and the military have been called in to assist in these countries. There was a very distinct crime wave happening in Latin America. The city that currently topped the list of the world's most violent cities is San Pedro Sula in Honduras, leading various media sources to label it the \"murder capital of the world.\" Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year that the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.\n\nCrime is slowing economic growth and undermining democratic consolidation in Latin America. Today, Latin America has the dubious distinction of being most violent region in the world, with combined crime rates more than triple the world average and are comparable to rates in nations experiencing war. This is taking a tremendous toll on development in the region by both affecting economic growth and public faith in democracy.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank estimates that Latin America's per capita Gross Domestic Product would be twenty-five percent higher if the region's crime rates were equal to the world average. Similarly, the World Bank has identified a strong correlation between crime and income inequality. Business associations in the region rank crime as the number one issue negatively affecting trade and investment.

A forerunner of Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 game developed by Interplay Productions to which the series is regarded as a spiritual successor.\n\nThe series' first title, Fallout, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997, and its sequel, Fallout 2, the following year. With the tactical role-playing game Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, development was handed to Micro Forté and 14 Degrees East. In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios,[2] and continued to produce Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, an action game with role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, without Black Isle Studios. Fallout 3, the third entry in the main series, was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks, and was followed by Fallout: New Vegas, developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout 4 was released in 2015, and Fallout 76 released on November 14, 2018.\n\nBethesda Softworks owns the rights to the Fallout intellectual property.[3] After acquiring it, Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) version of Fallout to Interplay. The MMORPG got as far as beta stage under Interplay,[4] but a lengthy legal dispute between Bethesda Softworks and Interplay halted the development of the game and led to its eventual cancellation, as Bethesda claimed in court that Interplay had not met the terms and conditions of the licensing contract. The case was settled in early 2012.[5]\n\nOrigins\nThe ideas of the Fallout series began with Interplay Productions' Wasteland, released in 1988. At that time, Interplay was not a publisher and used Electronic Arts for distribution of the game. According to Interplay's founder, Brian Fargo, they wanted to explore a post-apocalyptic setting and created Wasteland for that. Sometime after release, Interplay decided to shift focus and become a publisher while still developing games. Fargo wanted to continue to use the Wasteland intellectual property but could not negotiate the rights back from Electronic Arts. Still wanting to do something in a post-apocalyptic setting, Fargo and his team decided to make a new setting and game. They determined what aspects of Wasteland were positives and wrote and developed a new game around them. The result was the first Fallout games, which released nearly ten years after Wasteland.[6]", "response": "Fallout (1997)\nReleased in October 1997, Fallout takes place in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, beginning in the year 2161.

Afterwards, the Vault Dweller must thwart the plans of a group of mutants, led by a grotesque entity named the Master. Fallout was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system. However, a disagreement with the creator of GURPS, Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop the new SPECIAL system.[7] Fallout's atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-World War II United States during the Cold War era and the fear that the country was headed for nuclear war in the real world.[8]", "category": "summarization"}
{"instruction": "What are some tricks to baking a really good cake?", "context": "", "response": "There are several things to consider when baking a cake.  Paying particular attention to each will produce a consistent and delicious result.  First, confirm that your oven temperature is correct.  This is easily done with a meat thermometer.  Place the thermometer in the middle of the center rack of the oven, where most food cooks. Then preheat the oven to a baking temperature (e.g. 350 degrees).  After the oven has preheated, check the temperature on the thermometer and confirm that it also reads 350 degrees.   Second, bring your refrigerated ingredients to room temperature before using.  If your recipe calls for butter, do not microwave it as a shortcut.  Doing so will change the consistency of your batter.  Plan ahead and leave butter and eggs out on the counter for at least an hour before you begin baking.  Third, pay close attention to recipe instructions related to sifting and measuring flour.  \"Two cups sifted flour\" does not mean the same thing as \"two cups flour, sifted.\"  The first instruction means to sift the flour, then measure; whereas the second means measure first, then sift what was measured.  In either scenario, do not scoop the measuring cup into the flour bin directly.  This causes the flour to be tightly packed into the cup and will result in a cake that has the texture of a brick.  Instead, use a spoon to lightly scoop flour from the bin into the measuring cup, leveling off the top with a butter knife.  This method is messier, but will yield better results.  Fourth, take the time to cream the butter and sugar well.  The result should be smooth and lump free.  This is the most important step to making an appealing cake, and again can't be expedited by using melted butter!  Fifth, if your recipe calls for both wet ingredients (buttermilk, juice etc) and dry (flour mixture), alternate between the two in small increments rather than dumping them in sequentially.  This small step will protect the texture of your cake.  Sixth, once the cake batter has been poured into the pan, lift the pan and drop it onto the counter from a height of two to three inches.  This will remove any air pockets that may have developed in the batter.  Be careful not to bang the pan too hard, or you'll spill the batter and/or scare your pets out of the kitchen.   And lastly, don't bake the cake for as long as the recipe suggests. Set the timer a few minutes early so that you don't over-bake due to any idiosyncrasy associated with your oven (referenced in step one). Please note this does not mean you should be opening and closing the oven door multiple times during the baking process.  Good bakers know \"if you're looking, it's not cooking,\" so try not to open the oven until your timer goes off.  The only exception to this rule is if you smell something burning.  Odds are this means the batter has spilled out over the pan and onto the bottom of the oven.  if this happens, and the oven is now smoking, you have to open the door and try to remove the spill.  If nothing is smoking, leave the mess until the cake is out and the oven has cooled.  Back to the timer - When it goes off, quickly but carefully test the cake with several toothpicks in different areas while the cake remains in the oven. (Taking the cake in and out of the oven to test will change the temperature of both the oven and the cake).  If the toothpicks are wet and sticky, the cake needs more time. If the toothpicks are clean (or a tad moist), the cake is ready to come out of the oven.   Allow cake to cool on a rack, and then enjoy the fruits of your labor!", "category": "general_qa"}

While officially, Jim was let go due to \"budgetary constraints\", it was quite clear to him that it had more to do with his age than any financial strain on the school district. See, Jim was born in 1899, he had just turned 75 years old in January and was starting to \"slow down\" on the job. He could no longer do some of the highly intensive labor that his profession often entailed, and it became noticeable. \n\nAfter his last day of work, Jim walked to his home, which conveniently was only three blocks south of the school. On his walk, he couldn't help but feel sad and slightly embarrassed. He knew that his wife, Miriam, would understand, but he felt like he let her and himself down. For nearly 40 years, Jim worked at Elmhurst Elementary School and was beloved by the thousands of students that came through those doors. While he wasn't going to miss cleaning up student's throw-up or a cafeteria that resembled more of a war zone than a public eating space, he was going to miss the children. Watching them learn, play, and grow was always what made the job worth it to him.\n\nWhen Jim walked through the door of his one story home, Miriam was there to greet him. She could tell what had happened by the look on his face. Particularly, she could tell by his eyes. Jim's eyes were a portal into his soul and, as such, a window into his emotions.\n\nAs Jim walked through the living room and into the kitchen, he saw two people, a man and a woman, sitting at the table, and in the woman's arms was a baby. This man was his son, Tommy, who he had not seen since he deployed for the Vietnam War three years prior. Up until this moment, Jim wasn't even sure if his son was alive. Jim's eyes opened wide with sheer elation at the sight, and a tear slowly formed in the corner of his left eye.\n\nOver the next few hours, Jim sat with his son and his family and discussed all that had happened since the last time they had seen each other. Tommy spoke about how he had been designated as MIA by the US government after a particularly brutal ambush during one of his morning patrols. After many months of hiding from the enemy and searching for his unit, Tommy eventually stumbled across one of the final remaining US camps stationed in South Vietnam. It was at this camp that Tommy met his now wife, Sara. She was the nurse who oversaw his recovery. They fell in love immediately, got married, and Sara became pregnant, all before even leaving Vietnam for the United States. Tommy and Sara had returned to the US only a month ago, and their baby was born two weeks later.\n\nWhile Jim laid in bed that night, he couldn't believe all the change that one day could bring. He woke up a janitor, and went to bed a grandfather. He knew his new job, and he looked forward to it. This was the best day of his life.", "category": "creative_writing"}

My friends and I are planning it out step by step, and hopefully at the end of the night, one of us will score a hot boy.\n“ You haven’t done any chores all month! I wish you were more like your step-sisters,” my stepmother continues angrily. The last part about my step-sisters really infuriated me. I storm downstairs ready to make a point that I’m not going to do chores for someone who isn’t my real mom.\n“Well maybe you're just jealous you didn’t peak in high school. I bet no one wanted to be your friend in school,” I argue. I put a smug look on my face, thinking that I totally just won this argument.\n“If you want to act like that I’ll give you the same treatment,” she warns me. She crosses her arms and taps her foot impatiently waiting for my response.\n“Whatever, if your're so fond of my step-sisters they can just do my chores,” I sigh as I roll my eyes.\n“You need to learn how to take care of yourself. Soon enough, your only achievement would be peaking in high school.

My life is literally ruined. She is seriously out to get me I swear. I flip my hair and start to walk over to my room.\n“I’m going to run some errands. When I’m back, I expect all the clothes to be folded, the kitchen wiped down, etcetera. Perhaps if you finish fast enough, you can still make it to the party. Maybe.” She orders and walks out of the house.\nThis is child abuse. I stomp my foot in frustration and call all my friends.

You guys now I can’t live without those!” I point out. I pace back and forth around my room trying to think. I see an empty closet and get the perfect idea.\n           “What if I just throw in all the dirty things into the closet! That will give me enough time. She probably won’t notice for a couple of days. It’s flawless!” I proposed. Everyone agrees so I went straight to work.

It’s time to put on your long underwear. Slip in some wool socks and a sweater. Climb into your snowpants. Pull down your stocking cap. Grab your fi shing rod and bait bucket.\nThere’s ice on the lake, and it’s the season to enjoy a true Minnesota adventure, —ice fishing. Don’t worry about getting cold or bored on a frozen lake. Ice fishing is both easy and exciting. It’s fun to hike across the ice imagining hungry sunnies or walleyes lurking below. It’s an adventure to hang out around an ice hole with friends and family, telling stories and holding a funny looking fishing rod as you wait for a bite. And it’s thrilling when your bobber suddenly  vanishes down the hole, and you pull a slippery fish from the water with a splash. So grab a grown-up, a Thermos of hot cocoa, and get ready for an ice fishing adventure.\n\nStart with a visit to your local bait store or DNR Fisheries office. Folks there can tell you in which lakes the fish are biting and where you can get onto the lake. They can also tell you where the ice is most likely to be OK. Wind, warm weather, underwater springs, and currents can all make ice unsafe. Ice must be at least 4 inches thick before you walk on it. (See Be Safe, page 45.) Once you know the ice is thick enough, you can go find a fishing spot. Here are three ways to look: § If you know where fish hang out in summer, go there. Fish usually go to the same places in winter. § Pick up a lake map at the bait shop or DNR and look for shallow areas or drop-offs (where the bottom gets deep quickly). Fish are more likely to be there. § Look for anglers congregated at the best fishing holes. Ask if you can fish near them. (It’s not polite to drill holes too close to other anglers.) If the fish aren’t biting in one spot, try another.\n\nYou can use a regular reel, or some anglers use a device called a tip-up instead. A tipup has two sticks. One lies across the hole. The other points down into the hole and has a spool with line. When a fish takes your bait, a flag springs up from the stick across the hole. Then you pull the fish up with the line. Tip-ups are fun because you can watch them while reading a book or tossing a Frisbee.\n\n1.\tCut a Hole.\na.\tTo catch fish through the ice, you must first drill a hole. To drill a hole, ice anglers use a tool called an auger, which looks like a giant screw with a sharp blade on the end. Another handy tool is a spud, a long-handled chisel with a sharp blade for checking ice thickness and chipping extra ice from the hole. Anglers use a scoop, a big spoon with holes, to clean out ice shavings.\n\n2.\t Find the Depth\na.\tIf you know the depth of the water, you have a better idea what fish to fish for. Bluegills and northerns like shallow water. Look for walleyes in deeper water. Some anglers use an electronic fish locator or a lead weight on a hook. You can also tie a string to a weight, hold the loose end in one hand, and drop the weigh to the bottom. Then measure the length of string that’s down the hole. The simplest solution is to use a weighted hook, which drops to the bottom. Then you reel it up to fish as far off the bottom as you like. \n\n3.\tLand your Catch\na.\tWhen you feel a fish on the line, reel it up steadily but not too fast because you might yank out the hook. When you see the fish, ask your adult fishing buddy to lift it out. After landing a fish, remove it from the hook. It’s easier to get a hook out with pliers than with your hands in cold weather. If the fish is too big or too small to keep, return it to the water. Or put your catch in a bucket or a snowbank. Watch out for dogs! A dog might try to run away with your catch! It happens. \n\n4.\tUse Good Manners\na.\tBe polite and don’t disturb your fellow anglers with loud talk or goofing around. Always pick up your trash and anything else you brought. Remember: Anything you leave on the lake will go into the water when the ice melts.", "category": "creative_writing"}

The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the Amanita muscaria, with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap.

Everyone has a role to play in getting us there and delivering for customers and growing the business is the most important thing most of us can do.\n\nA typical milestone on a high-growth journey is an IPO. But as companies get more serious about a potential IPO, there is a period where they stop talking about an IPO.  This might be counter-intuitive, but here’s why: there are important regulatory restrictions on what companies can and cannot say when it comes to company growth and plans as they approach becoming a public company. The consequences if you don’t follow those rules can be serious — the SEC can even delay our ability to go public if it determines we’ve improperly promoted an IPO. And that’s obviously a situation we want to avoid, should we be in a position to go public in the future.  \n\nAnd even language like this — \"should we be in a position to go public in the future\" — is vague. That's for a reason: as we get closer to an IPO, what we can say is restricted and we need to make sure we don’t make promises, otherwise regulators could force us to delay our plans.\n\nSo I’m going to share some updates about how we’ll need to communicate related to a potential IPO:\n\nIn order to preserve the ability to IPO at some point in the future, the executive team and I will not be sharing explicit details on our IPO journey or timing at All Hands or in other company communications. We also won’t be sharing updates to our market valuation. \n\nHiring managers and recruiters should not explicitly talk about an IPO or our revenue growth with candidates. Instead, emphasize our massive opportunity, how we’re innovating, delivering value to our customers, and what an awesome team we have.  \n\nWe can’t engage with public market investors or financial journalists on certain topics. That means if a financial analyst, research analyst or reporter reaches out to you, don’t respond and forward the email to the communications team.\n\nWe also can’t talk about a potential IPO on social media or with friends and family. You get the idea.\n\nI know that this will be different for us. We’ve always been a transparent company and this change is hopefully a short-term one.

{"instruction": "What are redo logs in Oracle RDBMS?", "context": "In the Oracle RDBMS environment, redo logs comprise files in a proprietary format which log a history of all changes made to the database. Each redo log file consists of redo records. A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database.\n\nFor example, if a user UPDATEs a salary-value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then COMMITs the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \"system change number\" (SCN).\n\nWhenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE command.", "response": "In Oracle RDBM, redo logs are the logs which are used to maintain the history of changes in a database.

It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. The rules of chess as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.\n\nChess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no use of dice or cards. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. Checkmating the opponent's king involves putting the king under immediate attack (in \"check\") whereby there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nOrganized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.\n\nOne of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.", "response": "Chess is a two player turn based abstract strategy board game with the goal of checkmating the opponents King. The game originated from a similar board game from India called Chatarunga, which was played during the 17th century.\n\nChess boards have 64 squares arranged into an 8x8 grid with alternating white and black squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and eight pawns. Each piece has a predefined mode of movement. Each player's pieces are uniformly colored; for example if player one has the white pieces, player one will start the match. \n\nCheckmating the opponents king requires the opponent to position their pieces into an attacking arrangement that prohibits the defending players king from moving. This is usually accomplished by closing in on their defending opponents king and systematically working towards positions where the king can no longer move without being taken. If the king is under attack (meaning the king is in a position where the opponents next move will take the king) the defensive player must either take the attacking piece with any piece on the board or move the king to a position where the king is no longer under attach, this configuration is called \"Check\" or being \"Checked\". Chess matches can also end in a draw.\n\nChess arose in popularity in the 19th century and is governed internationally by the FIDE (international chess federation).

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. \nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers.

The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, featuring thousands of islands. The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.5 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras.\n\nGreece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to the North Western parts of India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. Over the first hundred years the kingdom of Greece sought its territorial expansion, which was mainly achieved in the early 20th century, during the Balkan Wars and up until the catastrophe of Greece's Asia Minor Campaign in 1922. The short-lived republic that followed, beset by the ramifications of civil strife, came to an end in 1936, when the imposition of a royalist dictatorship inaugurated a long period of authoritarian rule, marked by military occupation during World War II, civil war and military dictatorship.

In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.[7]", "response": "The paragraph discussed racial manipulation in the 19th to 20th centuries.

Indeed, any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment. The only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1°. Also, superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes, so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures.[1] Eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor's cellular construction, with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated (as in the vertebrates) or rhabdomeric. These two groups are not monophyletic; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells, [10] and some gastropods,[11] as well as some annelids possess both.[12]\n\nSome organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark, which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms.

If the leak only happens when it is raining, then shut off the main water supply and see if the leak still happens.  If yes, then it is likely from rain.  If it has been sunny and dry for a week and you are still getting the leak, shut the water off and see if the leak stops.  If it does, then that is likely from an internal leak.  If it is in fact an internal leak, then call a reputable local plumber to have them test your pipes for pressure loss.  If it is an external leak, then wait for sunny weather.  After about a week of dry sunny weather, get a garden hose and pick a feature of your roof or external walls and spray that feature (vent pipe, window, roof juncture, etc) with a direct stream of high volume and low velocity water from the garden hose.  Wait for a few hours, and see if the leak appears.  After four hours, if no leak has appeared, then move on to the next feature.

In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition.[6] Its highest priority is its Christian principles.

If there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area, mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via Pioneer. Thus, Pioneer 11 was acting as a \"pioneer\" in a true sense of the word; if danger were detected, then the Voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings, but missing the opportunity to visit Uranus and Neptune in the process.\n\nPioneer 11 imaged and nearly collided with one of Saturn's small moons, passing at a distance of no more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 mi). The object was tentatively identified as Epimetheus, a moon discovered the previous day from Pioneer's imaging, and suspected from earlier observations by Earth-based telescopes. After the Voyager flybys, it became known that there are two similarly sized moons (Epimetheus and Janus) in the same orbit, so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of Pioneer's near-miss.

{"instruction": "Who does Machiavelli believe exemplifies the characteristics of a true prince in The Prince, and why does he hold this belief?", "context": "", "response": "In Machiavelli’s, The Prince, Machiavelli describes in great detail the extent to which a true prince should rule their state to ensure complete dominance and obedience of its people. He explains the numerous prerequisites and responsibilities of a prince, in which he exemplifies throughout the text through the different figures, in both positive and negative contexts. Throughout The Prince, one figure, who Machiavelli makes clear he has great respect for, highlighting quite frequently, is Cesare Borgia whom he even refers to with the status comparable to the level of God exclaiming that “there was one man who showed glimpses of greatness... that made you think he was sent by God” (26). Similar rhetoric is frequently used to describe Cesare Borgia throughout the text. In search of who truly exemplifies the characterization of “The Prince,” it can generally seem to be Cesare Borgia from the high praise of Machiavelli, but in reality this is not the case. Rather, the title of “The Prince” belongs to a more subtle figure: Ferdinand of Aragon, the King of Spain. This connection is made because of the numerous contradictions Machiavelli makes in praise of Cesare Borgia and other important figures in the text, while many key characteristics of a true prince that Machiavelli speaks of hold without contradiction for Ferdinand.\nMachiavelli exemplifies his teachings through Cesare Borgia’s actions seen in chapter 7 when Cesare Borgia conquered the state of Romagna: immediately crushing the opponent using great cruelty, using a scapegoat to thwart the hatred away from him, and finally killing the scapegoat to create a sense of power and fear within the new states inhabitants. These actions, that explain why he is so highly idolized by Machiavelli, do not go without the fact that other\n \n fundamental characteristics of Cesare Borgia directly contradict Machiavelli's notion of the most dominant prince. A prime example is in how “Cesare Borgia... acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it” (7). Inheritance obviously requires significantly less effort compared to creating a new principality. Although Cesare Borgia later conquers new principalities, it can be inferred that a rise to power through his fathers fortune was a significant catalyst and does not exemplify virtues of the ideal prince.\nOther figures in the book receive similar praise in leadership abilities, but still lack what qualities compare to the ideal prince. These figures include Pope Julius II, whose power is highlighted by Machiavelli in chapter 13 as being consistent more with fortune rather than virtù in his campaign for conquer, Pope Alexander VI, who although displays cunning ability to bring the catholic empire eventual dominance and power, did so with the initial help of being “granted a title and income from the Roman Catholic Church by his uncle Alonso”.1 Many figures follow the same pattern in that they follow many principles exemplified in The Prince, but of course with so many requisites to be a true prince, these figures do not follow the explicit definition of a prince. One figure however, follows Machiavelli’s points very closely and exemplifies the fundamentals of a true prince in his beginnings, leaving almost no flaws in his rise to becoming a true prince: Ferdinand of Aragon.\nFerdinand’s characteristics lead him to the title of “The Prince” but a core virtù is what truly sets him apart from the other figures: his rise to power.

This is largely evident in Ferdinand’s rise to leadership in what Machiavelli describes him as “[rising], by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom” (21). Ferdinand demonstrates his cunning deception through his plot for power, “always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, [devoting] himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors” (21). Machiavelli marks this never being “a more admirable example, nor one more rare” in which he uses religion as a cloak of invisibility to deceptively conquer states (21). These natural abilities are what make Ferdinand admirable and what separate him from the rest of the figures in the text. This feeling is shared by Machiavelli exclaiming “that his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him” (21).", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "Give me a proof that the square root of 2 is irrational", "context": "", "response": "Here is a proof by contradiction that the square root of 2 is irrational. First, recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as p / q for integers p and q. Assume for contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational, which would mean that sqrt(2) = p / q for some integers p and q. Further assume without loss of generality that this fraction is in reduced form, meaning that p and q share no common factors. We can assume this because any integer fraction can be written in such a reduced form, so the existence of any rational representation for sqrt(2) would imply the existence of one in reduced form. Now we square both sides of the above equation, yielding\n\n2 = p^2 / q^2\n\nfor some integers p and q not sharing any common factors. Now multiply by q^2 to get\n\n2 * q^2 = p^2\n\nNote that the left hand side is even due to the factor of 2, so the right hand side p^2 is even as well. This means that p must be even as well, otherwise p^2 would not be even. So p can be written as 2 * x for some integer x. Substituting this into the above equation, we get\n\n2 * q^2 = (2 * x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2\n\nNote that both sides of the equation have a factor of 2 we can cancel. Doing this, we get\n\nq^2 = 2 * x^2\n\nBy an argument analogous to the one above, we can conclude that q is even. However this contradicts our assumption that p and q shared no common factors. Therefore our initial assumption that sqrt(2) is rational was false, which is what we set out to prove.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "what is cricket and why is it popular in Asian countries?", "context": "", "response": "Cricket is one of the most popular sports in Asian countries. One of the worlds biggest cricket teams are India. The reason for so much popularity is multifold. Top reason is when English invaded South east asia they brought this game to the continent. Originally this game was only played by upper class, and later adopted by other classes as well. To play cricket you need one bat and one ball. Bat will be made up of wood and ball can be either tennis ball or hard ball which is made up of leather. You need a wicket which is 3 sticks and 2 bails on top. One person throws the ball and other person try to protect his wickets with the bat. The length of the wicket is 22 yards. Batsman can hit the ball for runs. To make runs, there are two ways. First is to hit the boundary, which can fetch either 4 or 6 runs. Second way is to run between the wickets and make as many runs as you can. There are other ways to get runs as well, like if its a wide ball or no ball. For a team to win a match, they either have to make more runs then the other team or get them all out before they can make more runs then them. Most popular cricket format is T20, then One day internationals (ODI) and then Test matches. T20 is the shortest form and have 20 overs and 2 innings. ODI has 50 overs and 2 innings. Whereas Test is the longest format and can carry on for 5 days, with 90 overs every day and up to 2 innings per team. Both men and women play cricket. Worlds biggest cricket league is IPL in india. PSL in Pakistan is considered as the second best league. There are 2 cricket worldcups. T20 worldcup is played every 2 years and ODI worldcup is played every 4 years.

The variability seen among individuals may be attributed to the differences in their genotypes. With an incidence of 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 50,000 live births, it is suggested to be one of the most common contiguous gene deletion disorders. 5p deletions are most common de novo occurrences, which are paternal in origin in 80–90% of cases, possibly arising from chromosome breakage during gamete formation in males.\n\nSome examples of the possible dysmorphic features include: downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, microcephaly, low-set ears, preauricular tags, round faces, short neck, micrognathia, and dental malocclusionhypertelorism, epicanthal folds, downturned corners of the mouth. There is no specific correlation found between size of deletion and severity of clinical features because the results vary so widely.\n\nThe chromosomal basis of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) consists of a deletion of the most terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 4. The deleted segment of reported individuals represent about one half of the p arm, occurring distal to the bands 4p15.1-p15.2. The proximal boundary of the WHSCR was defined by a 1.9 megabase terminal deletion of 4p16.3. This allele includes the proposed candidate genes LEMT1 and WHSC1. This was identified by two individuals that exhibited all 4 components of the core WHS phenotype, which allowed scientists to trace the loci of the deleted genes. Many reports are particularly striking in the appearance of the craniofacial structure (prominent forehead, hypertelorism, the wide bridge of the nose continuing to the forehead) which has led to the descriptive term “Greek warrior helmet appearance\".\n\nThere is wide evidence that the WHS core phenotype (growth delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and distinctive craniofacial features) is due to haploinsufficiency of several closely linked genes as opposed to a single gene. Related genes that impact variation include:\n\nWHSC1 spans a 90-kb genomic region, two-thirds of which maps in the telomeric end of the WHCR; WHSC1 may play a significant role in normal development. Its deletion likely contributes to the WHS phenotype. However, variation in severity and phenotype of WHS suggests possible roles for genes that lie proximally and distally to the WHSCR.\nWHSC2 (also known as NELF-A) is involved in multiple aspects of mRNA processing and the cell cycle\nSLBP, a gene encoding Stem Loop Binding Protein, resides telomeric to WHSC2, and plays a crucial role in regulating histone synthesis and availability during S phase.\nLETM1 has initially been proposed as a candidate gene for seizures; it functions in ion exchange with potential roles in cell signaling and energy production.\nFGFRL1, encoding a putative fibroblast growth factor decoy receptor, has been implicated in the craniofacial phenotype and potentially other skeletal features, and short stature of WHS.\nCPLX1 has lately been suggested as a potential candidate gene for epilepsy in WHS.\n\nPrader–Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurogenetic disorders caused by chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy or loss of the imprinted gene expression in the 15q11-q13 region. Whether an individual exhibits PWS or AS depends on if there is a lack of the paternally expressed gene to contribute to the region.[citation needed]\n\nPWS is frequently found to be the reason for secondary obesity due to early onset hyperphagia - the abnormal increase in appetite for consumption of food. There are known three molecular causes of Prader–Willi syndrome development. One of them consists in micro-deletions of the chromosome region 15q11–q13. 70% of patients present a 5–7-Mb de novo deletion in the proximal region of the paternal chromosome 15. The second frequent genetic abnormality (~ 25–30% of cases) is maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. The mechanism is due to maternal meiotic non-disjunction followed by mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 15 after fertilization. The third cause for PWS is the disruption of the imprinting process on the paternally inherited chromosome 15 (epigenetic phenomena). This disruption is present in approximately 2–5% of affected individuals. Less than 20% of individuals with an imprinting defect are found to have a very small deletion in the PWS imprinting centre region, located at the 5′ end of the SNRPN gene.\n\nAS is a severe debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, speech impairment, seizures, motor dysfunction, and a high prevalence of autism. The paternal origin of the genetic material that is affected in the syndrome is important because the particular region of chromosome 15 involved is subject to parent-of-origin imprinting, meaning that for a number of genes in this region, only one copy of the gene is expressed while the other is silenced through imprinting. For the genes affected in PWS, it is the maternal copy that is usually imprinted (and thus is silenced), while the mutated paternal copy is not functional.", "category": "summarization"}

As with other types of loans, mortgages have an interest rate and are scheduled to amortize over a set period of time, typically 30 years. All types of real property can be, and usually are, secured with a mortgage and bear an interest rate that is supposed to reflect the lender's risk.\n\nMortgage lending is the primary mechanism used in many countries to finance private ownership of residential and commercial property (see commercial mortgages).

In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).[5] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "What are the various methods to offer support for the improvement of the traditionally underprivileged sections of the society?", "context": "", "response": "In many societies there are sections of people who are underprivileged. These people could be underprivileged because of several factors: ethnicity, religion, colour, language, nationality, gender, etc. The other people who do not come under the underprivileged section are the normal people.\n\nThe underprivileged people suffer major struggles in their life over decades or sometime over centuries. On the social development indices such as literacy, life expectancy, incarceration, health conditions, etc.. the underprivileged people lag behind the normal people significantly. Examples of underprivileged people include the indigenous people in many countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA and also the people of African descent in the USA. \n\nThe people from the underprivileged communities have to brought into the mainstream and in order to achieve this objective,  the required job and career opportunities have to be created. Education is a powerful tool to equip the people to gain the skills required to perform the roles. These people have been deprived of education for a long time and so the governments and the social leaders have to take the initiatives to extend education to the underprivileged. There has to be a concerted effort over a long time, some times for even 50 to 100 years, to improve the skill levels of the underprivileged people by focusing on education and training.\n\nThe underprivileged people have to be empowered citizens of the society. In order to enable these people to overcome the handicap of the suppression they have suffered for a long time, leaders from these communities have to be involved in the decision making and governance forums in the society.  As an example, in Indian Parliament around 24% of the seats are reserved only for people from the underprivileged sections to contest and get elected to become members of the parliament. Using this model to reserve seats for the. underprivileged in the governance bodies, we can provide opportunity for the underprivileged to participate in the governance and enact laws that will protect their interests. \n\nA combination of education and empowerment would go a long way in improving the life of the underprivileged people in the society.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "Should heritage trees in Palo Alto be protected once they become a danger to people and homes?", "context": "", "response": "Strong winds driven, likely driven by climate change,  are posing new challenges to tree protection ordinances in northern California cities like Palo Alto, California. Climate change has caused stronger winds to occur in SF Bay Area. These strong gusts, some of which can be over 60 mph, are causing large, historic trees to fall onto houses threatening costly real estate as well as peoples lives. In the city of Palo Alto, California Oaks and Redwoods are classified as heritage trees. These majestic trees grow throughout the city and for many years have been vigilantly protected.  These trees are considered part of the city's unique character and history, therefore a part of its heritage.  Heritage trees cannot be cut down without the permission of a special city governance body and getting this okay to do so is very hard if not impossible to do.  The trees are beautiful and protecting them is noble, but  in the new era of unprecedented high winds some residents are asking if  their protection should be reconsidered given the risk they present to people and their homes during a storm. \n\nWhile storms are dramatic and do cause damage, they also occur infrequently and are a natural part of life.  Heritage oak and redwood trees which take hundreds of years to grow do pose some risks to homes and people should they fall, but overall they pose an insignificant risk to humans and buildings and need to continue to be protected in order to continue to provide their many benefits to humans.", "category": "creative_writing"}

Depending on when you fly, your ticket class, and how close to your departure date that you buy your tickets, pricing can vary from less than $100 (91 Euros) to over $500 (455 Euros). Be sure to plan your trip and purchase tickets in advance to ensure that you save money. Also, while Munich has one major airport (MUC), Rome has two large international airports (FCO and CIA). It will take roughly 90 minutes by plane to travel from Munich to Rome, not accounting for time in the airport, security lines and customs.\n\n2. By train - Traveling by train is another common way to get from Munich to Rome. While it will take longer than by air, tickets are very inexpensive and can be purchased the day of travel. A one way train ticket from Munich to Rome will cost roughly $35 (32 Euros), and take between 9-12 hours, depending on the route and number of stops.\n\n3. By car - Traveling by car from Munich to Rome is also an option. With limited stops, it will take roughly 10 hours to drive from Munich to Rome, but having a car will allow you flexibility to stop along the way at any cities or sites that you want to see. \n\nDepending on your specific needs, all three of these options could be viable ways to travel from Munich to Rome.", "category": "brainstorming"}

{"instruction": "Is brazilian jiu jitsu good for self defense?", "context": "", "response": "Brazilian Jiujitsu, or BJJ, is known as the gentle art in martial arts.  BJJ can be practiced in two modalities: Sport BJJ and the other as self defense. Sport BJJ is competitive and based on a point system based on a competitor being awarded a number of points based on advancing to a more advantageous position. Alternatively, a competitor may immediately win the match by submission. When BJJ is used in self defense, the goal is usually to subdue an attacker.  Since BJJ is mostly grappling from the ground, it can be a highly effective practice for self defense as many street fights end up on the ground. While many of the techniques are intended to immobilize an opponent, it can be less effective if the opponent has an unfair advantage such as the use of a weapon. Practicing BJJ routinely will prepare the practitioner mentally for physical combat which can be advantageous in a self defense scenario. Another reason BJJ can be viewed as good for self defense is that there are techniques that can work well for different body types that level the playing field for even smaller or weaker opponents. If both opponents are trained in BJJ, size and strength can become a larger factor.  Routine training can also lead to increased physical fitness as classes can be quite rigorous and physically demanding. Some may argue that more ruthless martial arts are intentionally designed for self defense and therefore may be more effective.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "What are the different types of art?", "context": "", "response": "There isn’t one single agreed classification of art forms. In part, this is because there is not one single definition of art! \n\nSome people consider art a creative process that gives only aesthetic pleasure, and does not serve any utilitarian purpose. However, even with this definition, there is not a clear dividing line between art and utilitarian creative processes. For example, some people consider the literary arts to comprise poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and drama. We can clearly understand that non-fiction has a utilitarian purpose to educate and communicate, and arguably the other literary arts do too. So that definition of art as serving no utilitarian purpose is not very black-and-white. \n\nIf we consider art to be any creative endeavor that provides aesthetic pleasure, and that it might also be utilitarian, then there are many forms of art. Below is a partial listing, together with some of the ways these are commonly grouped together. \n\n\nArt form | Can be classified as\nPoetry | Literary arts, fine arts\nFiction | Literary arts\nNon-fiction | Literary arts\nDrama / theater | Performing arts, literary arts\nSculpture | Visual arts, fine arts, plastic arts\nPainting | Visual arts, fine arts\nGlassblowing | Visual arts\nCeramics | Visual arts, plastic arts\nOrigami | Visual arts, plastic arts\nWoodworking | Sculpture, plastic arts\nMusic | Performing arts, fine arts\nDance | Performing arts, fine arts\nFilm-making / cinematography | Performing arts, visual arts, media arts\nPhotography | Visual arts, media arts\nOpera | Performing arts, visual arts\nFood preparation | Culinary arts\nFood styling | Visual arts, culinary arts\nArchitecture | Fine arts\n\nThere are also subcategories of many of these art forms, for example:\nSculpture using different materials can have its own subcategory. Some people consider glassblowing or wood carving to be subcategories of sculpture.\nWoodworking has sub-specialties including engraving, furniture-making, and carving.\n  \nThere is also disagreement about including utilitarian disciplines as a form of art. Architecture is a good example of this. It is highly regulated, requires engineering skill, and provides clear useful benefits, so it doesn’t meet the standard of “purely aesthetic”. Still, it is common to consider architecture an art form, and most people agree that architecture can provide aesthetic pleasure.\n\nAs you can see, there isn’t a single way to classify art forms, although there is consensus about some of the most common groupings.", "category": "classification"}

Our first date had been the weekend before, when we'd gone to a Jimmy Buffett concert.

Natalie, being from DC, wanted to show me the Dumbarton Oaks Gardens, so off we went.  Unfortunately, when we got there, the front gates were closed.

Towards the back end of the property, while we didn't find an open gate, we did find one that was scale-able.  And that's exactly what we did.  We climbed over that fence, and welcomed ourselves to the beautiful gardens.  It was early august, and so much was still in bloom.  The gardens were empty,  and we thought we had the whole place to ourselves.  But, we soon found that that wasn't the case.  While exploring a small cottage that also seemed to double as an art gallery, we noticed a small pool right next to it.  We also noticed someone swimming in that pool. Presumably that person noticed us too, because a few minutes later a security guard came walking up to us while we were inspecting some fine smelling roses nearby.  It was too late to run away, so instead we walked up to the security guard, and thanked him for finding us.  As they escorted us out, we complimented them on the great state of the garden, though that didn't seem to calm him down much.  He was far too frustrated with the situation.  As they were about to lead us out through the front gate, we offered to pay for our admission.

{"instruction": "List different ways in which Nuclear power can be obtained based on the passage.", "context": "Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2. Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research.\n\nMost nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years. It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long term storage. The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste. While its radioactivity decreases exponentially it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to reduce this significantly. Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g. France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication in new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium. All reactors breed some plutonium-239, which is found in the spent fuel, and because Pu-239 is the preferred material for nuclear weapons, reprocessing is seen as a weapon proliferation risk.", "response": "Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions.", "category": "information_extraction"}

Manchin and Sinema negotiated the reduction of Build Back Better Act's size, scope, and cost significantly with Biden and Democratic congressional leaders, but Manchin, widely viewed as the key swing vote needed to pass the bill in the Senate, ultimately rejected it over the procedural tactics used.[6] Continued negotiations between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer eventually resulted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law in August 2022, and incorporated some of the Build Back Better Act's climate change, healthcare, and tax reform proposals while excluding its social safety net proposals.[7]", "response": "The three components of the Build Back Better plan are:\n- American Rescue Plan\n- American Jobs Plan\n- American Families Plan", "category": "closed_qa"}

This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\n\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\n\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe and set the foundation for the international order of the world's nations during the Cold War and into present day. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts,[1] with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities, and forge a sense of common identity.", "response": "The main countries involved in World War II were Germany, Japan, Italy, United Kingdom, United States, Soviet Union, and China and there were divided into two opposing alliances called the Allies and the Axis.

{"instruction": "From the provided description of the cheesemaking process, list the ingredients required to make cheese.", "context": "The goal of cheese making is to control the spoiling of milk into cheese. The milk is traditionally from a cow, goat, sheep or buffalo, although, in theory, cheese could be made from the milk of any mammal. Cow's milk is most commonly used worldwide. The cheesemaker's goal is a consistent product with specific characteristics (appearance, aroma, taste, texture). The process used to make a Camembert will be similar to, but not quite the same as, that used to make Cheddar.\n\nSome cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne spores and bacteria; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.\n\nCulturing\nCheese is made by bringing milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').\n\nStarter cultures are chosen to give a cheese its specific characteristics. In the case of mould-ripened cheese such as Stilton, Roquefort or Camembert, mould spores (fungal spores) may be added to the milk in the cheese vat or can be added later to the cheese curd.\n\nCoagulation\nDuring the fermentation process, once sufficient lactic acid has been developed, rennet is added to cause the casein to precipitate. Rennet contains the enzyme chymosin which converts κ-casein to para-κ-caseinate (the main component of cheese curd, which is a salt of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds over a period of time.\n\n\nFresh chevre hanging in cheesecloth to drain.\nDraining\nOnce the cheese curd is judged to be ready, the cheese whey must be released. As with many foods the presence of water and the bacteria in it encourages decomposition. To prevent such decomposition it is necessary to remove most of the water (whey) from the cheese milk, and hence cheese curd, to make a partial dehydration of the curd. There are several ways to separate the curd from the whey.\n\n\nMaturing cheese in a cheese cellar\nScalding\nIn making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately 39 °C (102 °F) to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in a process known as 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases to a desired level. The curd is then milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.\n\nMould-ripening\nMain article: Cheese ripening\nIn contrast to cheddaring, making cheeses like Camembert requires a more gentle treatment of the curd. It is carefully transferred to cheese hoops and the whey is allowed to drain from the curd by gravity, generally overnight. The cheese curds are then removed from the hoops to be brined by immersion in a saturated salt solution. The salt absorption stops bacteria growing, as with Cheddar. If white mould spores have not been added to the cheese milk it is applied to the cheese either by spraying the cheese with a suspension of mould spores in water or by immersing the cheese in a bath containing spores of, e.g., Penicillium candida.\n\nBy taking the cheese through a series of maturation stages where temperature and relative humidity are carefully controlled, allowing the surface mould to grow and the mould-ripening of the cheese by fungi to occur. Mould-ripened cheeses ripen very quickly compared to hard cheeses (weeks against months or years). This is because the fungi used are biochemically very active when compared with starter bacteria. Some cheeses are surface-ripened by moulds, such as Camembert and Brie, some are ripened internally, such as Stilton, which is pierced with stainless steel wires, to admit air to promote mould spore germination and growth, as with Penicillium roqueforti. Surface ripening of some cheeses, such as Saint-Nectaire, may also be influenced by yeasts which contribute flavour and coat texture. Others are allowed to develop bacterial surface growths which give characteristic colours and appearances, e.g. by the growth of Brevibacterium linens which gives an orange coat to cheeses.", "response": "The main ingredient used to make cheese is milk. Cow's milk is commonly used, though goat, sheep or buffalo can also be used, as could the milk of any mammal in theory. Starter cultures are typically added to aid in the culturing stage of the process. Rennet is added to the cheese milk to promote the separation into cheese curd and whey. Ultimately, salt is added to halt the production of acid later in the process. Finally, mould spores are introduced to assist in ripening. This can be added to the cheese milk early on in the process, or just prior to maturing.", "category": "information_extraction"}

{"instruction": "Based on the paragraph below, name some authors outside of Latin America who employ magical realism in their work.", "context": "Magic realism or magical realism is a style of literary fiction and art. It paints a realistic view of the world while also adding magical elements, often blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.[1] Magic realism often refers to literature in particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting, commonly found in novels and dramatic performances.[2]: 1–5  Despite including certain magic elements, it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy stories are often separated from reality.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Magical realism is often seen as an amalgamation of real and magical elements that produces a more inclusive writing form than either literary realism or fantasy.[4]\n\nThe term magic realism is broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous, and Matthew Strecher (1999) defines it as \"what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe.\"[10] The term and its wide definition can often become confused, as many writers are categorized as magical realists. The term was influenced by a German and Italian painting style of the 1920s which were given the same name.[2] In The Art of Fiction, British novelist and critic David Lodge defines magic realism: \"when marvellous and impossible events occur in what otherwise purports to be a realistic narrative - is an effect especially associated with contemporary Latin-American fiction (for example the work of the Colombian novelist, Gabriel García Marquez) but it is also encountered in novels from other continents, such as those of Günter Grass, Salman Rushdie and Milan Kundera. All these writers have lived through great historical convulsions and wrenching personal upheavals, which they feel they cannot be adequately represented in a discourse of undisturbed realism\", citing Kundera's The Book of Laughter and Forgetting as an exemplar. \"[11] Michiko Kakutani writes that \"The transactions between the extraordinary and the mundane that occur in so much Latin American fiction are not merely a literary technique, but also a mirror of a reality in which the fantastic is frequently part of everyday life.\"[12] Magical realism often mixes history and fantasy, as in Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, in which the children born at midnight on August 15, 1947, the moment of India's independence, are telepathically linked.\n\nIrene Guenther (1995) tackles the German roots of the term, and how an earlier magic realist art is related to a later magic realist literature;[13] meanwhile, magical realism is often associated with Latin-American literature, including founders of the genre, particularly the authors Gabriel García Márquez, Isabel Allende, Jorge Luis Borges, Juan Rulfo, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Elena Garro, Mireya Robles, Rómulo Gallegos and Arturo Uslar Pietri. In English literature, its chief exponents include Neil Gaiman, Salman Rushdie, Alice Hoffman, Nick Joaquin, and Nicola Barker. In Bengali literature, prominent writers of magic realism include Nabarun Bhattacharya, Akhteruzzaman Elias, Shahidul Zahir, Jibanananda Das and Syed Waliullah. In Japanese literature, one of the most important authors of this genre is Haruki Murakami. In Kannada literature, the writers Shivaram Karanth and Devanur Mahadeva have infused magical realism in their most prominent works. In Polish literature, magic realism is represented by Olga Tokarczuk, the 2018 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature.", "response": "While Latin American authors are most closely associated with magical realism, there are many others who adopt this style.

State governments must agree unanimously in the Council for the union to adopt some policies; for others, collective decisions are made by qualified majority voting.

{"instruction": "What are the earliest records of dried fruits in history?", "context": "Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "The earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes.

{"instruction": "What and how should you feed your baby?", "context": "", "response": "What to feed your baby depends on a number of factors ranging from their age, their health and your preferences. Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like — the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe — void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.  Spoon-fed means the caregiver is selecting the foods and feeding the baby.  There is no right or wrong way to feed your baby.

{"instruction": "In golf, what is the proper technique when hitting a bunker shot? Assume the bunker is green adjacent.", "context": "", "response": "If the bunker is near the pin, use your sand-wedge.  Also, ensure you properly examined the green, to understand its shape and slope.  Combine this with an understanding of your own skill levels to make a decision on where you wish the ball to land.  For example,  the more skilled you are at these shots, the more precise a location you can identify.  Conversely, the less skilled you are, the less precise you can be in your chosen location, and consequently the more you need to consider a range of potential directions.  In those latter cases, it is best to aim towards the middle of the green rather than the exact placement of the pin.  Once you've made a decision on location, go up to your ball in the bunker.  (Pro-tip: don't forget to bring the rake with you).  Choose an open stance, where your legs are aiming roughly 45 degrees more to the left of the selected landing location.  If you're left-handed, the reverse is true, and your legs are aiming to the right of the intended direction/location.  Dig your shoes roughly an inch into the sand, to get a solid footing.  Next, bring your club face down to the ball, without actually touching the sand (it is not legal to make contact with the sand prior to contact with the ball).  Open the club face so that it aims towards the intended location.  Look one more time at the intended direction, then look down at the ball, and commence your backswing.  The plane of your backswing should be out, inline with the direction of your legs, and roughly three quarters the length of a full swing.  Firmly and confidently accelerate in your downswing, and aim to make contact with the sand roughly half an inch behind the ball.  The sand between the ball and the club head will blunt some of the force from the swing, thereby reducing ball travel distance, while still conveying spin.  A well hit shot can cause the ball to land on the green and immediately stop, possibly even moving back in the direction of the player.  The force in the downswing, combined with the amount of sand caught by the club head, are significant contributors to the amount of backspin on the ball.  Once you're done. rake up your marks as you exit the bunker, leaving no trace that you were ever there.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "Given a reference text about the Battle of Thermopylae, tell me when the battle was fought, who the battle was between, how many Greek and Persian forces there were, how the Persian army was able to flank the Greek forces and who won the battle?", "context": "The Battle of Thermopylae (/θərˈmɒpɪliː/ thər-MOP-i-lee; Greek: Μάχη τῶν Θερμοπυλῶν, Máchē tōn Thermopylōn) was fought in 480 BC between the Achaemenid Persian Empire under Xerxes I and an alliance of Greek city-states led by Sparta under Leonidas I. Lasting over the course of three days, it was one of the most prominent battles of both the second Persian invasion of Greece and the wider Greco-Persian Wars.\n\nThe engagement at Thermopylae occurred simultaneously with the Battle of Artemisium: between July and September 480 BC. The second Persian invasion under Xerxes I was a delayed response to the failure of the first Persian invasion, which had been initiated by Darius I and ended in 490 BC by an Athenian-led Greek victory at the Battle of Marathon. By 480 BC, a decade after the Persian defeat at Marathon, Xerxes had amassed a massive land and naval force, and subsequently set out to conquer all of Greece. In response, the Athenian politician and general Themistocles proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae while simultaneously blocking the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium.\n\nAround the start of the invasion, a Greek force of approximately 7,000 men led by Leonidas marched north to block the pass of Thermopylae. Ancient authors vastly inflated the size of the Persian army, with estimates in the millions, but modern scholars estimate it at between 120,000 and 300,000 soldiers. They arrived at Thermopylae by late August or early September; the outnumbered Greeks held them off for seven days (including three of direct battle) before their rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the Greeks blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could traverse the narrow pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes revealed to the Persians the existence of a path leading behind the Greek lines. Subsequently, Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked by the Persians, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat along with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians. It has been reported that others also remained, including up to 900 helots and 400 Thebans. With the exception of the Thebans, most of whom reportedly surrendered, the Greeks fought the Persians to the death.\n\nThemistocles was in command of the Greek naval force at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek defensive strategy had required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, the decision was made to withdraw to the island of Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and then captured the evacuated city of Athens. The Greek fleet—seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada—attacked and defeated the invading force at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, reportedly losing many of his troops to starvation and disease while also leaving behind the Persian military commander Mardonius to continue the Achaemenid Empire's Greek campaign. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat Mardonius and his troops at the Battle of Plataea, ending the second Persian invasion.\n\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as a flagship example of the power of an army defending its native soil. The performance of the Greek defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and use of terrain as force multipliers.", "response": "The Battle of Thermopylae was fought in 480 BC.

{"instruction": "Give me a summary of the paragraph in your own words and it should be short", "context": "Recreational drug use is the use of one or more psychoactive drugs to induce an altered state of consciousness either for pleasure or for some other casual purpose or pastime.[1] When a psychoactive drug enters the user's body, it induces an intoxicating effect.[1] Generally, recreational drugs are divided into three categories: depressants (drugs that induce a feeling of relaxation and calmness), stimulants (drugs that induce a sense of energy and alertness), and hallucinogens (drugs that induce perceptual distortions such as hallucination).[2]\n\nIn popular practice, recreational drug use generally is a tolerated social behaviour,[1] rather than perceived as the medical condition of self-medication.[3] However, drug use and drug addiction are severely stigmatized everywhere in the world.[4][5] Many people also use prescribed and controlled depressants such as opioids, as well as opiates and benzodiazepines.[2] What controlled substances are considered generally unlawful to possess varies by country, but usually includes cannabis, cocaine, opioids, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. As of 2015, it is estimated that about 5% of people worldwide aged 15 to 65 (158 million to 351 million) had used controlled drugs at least once.[6]\n\nCommon recreational drugs include caffeine, commonly found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and chocolate; alcohol, commonly found in beer, wine, cocktails, and distilled spirits; nicotine, commonly found in tobacco, tobacco-based products, and electronic cigarettes; cannabis and hashish (with legality of possession varying inter/intra-nationally); and the controlled substances listed as controlled drugs in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) of the United Nations (UN). Since the early 2000s, the European Union (EU) has developed several comprehensive and multidisciplinary strategies as part of its drug policy in order to prevent the diffusion of recreational drug use and abuse among the European population and raise public awareness on the adverse effects of drugs among all member states of the European Union, as well as conjoined efforts with European law enforcement agencies, such as the Europol and EMCDDA, in order to counter organized crime and illegal drug trade in Europe.[7]", "response": "Recreational drug use refers to using certain drugs for enjoyment or leisure purposes instead of for medicinal reasons. Some common recreational drugs include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs like ecstasy. While many countries consider recreational drug use legal, there are still laws surrounding their consumption and distribution. The EU has implemented various policies aimed at reducing recreational drug use and addressing issues related to drug trafficking within its borders.\n\nPeople often take recreational drugs because they want to experience feelings of euphoria, increased energy levels, or enhanced sensory perception. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, including dependence, withdrawal symptoms, impaired judgment and motor skills, and even death. Additionally, recreational drug use can lead to legal consequences, financial problems, strained relationships, and health issues such as mental illness, organ damage, and overdose. Despite these risks, many individuals continue to engage in recreational drug use due to peer pressure, stress relief, or simply for the thrill of it. Overall, recreational drug use poses significant dangers to both individual users and society as a whole.", "category": "summarization"}

Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their \"physical and spiritual needs\". It is present in 133 countries,[4] running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief, and humanitarian aid to developing countries.\n\nThe theology of the Salvation Army is derived from Methodism, although it is distinctive in institution and practice. A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as \"lieutenant\" or \"major\". It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion. However, the Army's doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army's purposes are \"the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole\".[5]\n\nThe Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission, and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition.[6] Its highest priority is its Christian principles.

{"instruction": "From the text provided, extract the list of styles found on Budapest architecture. Separate them with a semi-colon.", "context": "Budapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern Palace of Arts, the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.[104][105][106]\n\nMost buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than 45 metres (148 ft). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.[107][108]\n\nIn the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest is represented on the entire timeline, starting with the Roman City of Aquincum representing ancient architecture.\n\nThe next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in Budapest. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Other buildings with Gothic features are the Inner City Parish Church, built in the 12th century,[109] and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century.[110] The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic, like the most well-known Budapest landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building[111] and the Matthias Church, where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).[112]\n\nThe next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture. One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary, and Budapest in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House, St. Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[113]\n\nDuring the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered Budapest, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with \"the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India\".[114] Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths. Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, Gül Baba is found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary's own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, named as Szechenyi. When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church (Budapest). The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—\"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon\".[114]\n\n\nThe most famous Budapest bridge, the Chain Bridge, the icon of the city's 19th century development, built in 1849\nAfter 1686, the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century.[115] There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.[115]\n\nThe Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style. Mihály Pollack (1773–1855) and József Hild (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum, the Lutheran Church of Budavár (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the Hungarian president, the Sándor Palace. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.[116] Budapest's two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Dohány Street and the Vigadó Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade, both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the Budapest Western Railway Station, which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 1877.[117]\n\n\nThe Hungarian Parliament, completed in 1904\nArt Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations.[118] Art Nouveau in Hungary (Szecesszió in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, Ödön Lechner (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the Museum of Applied Arts. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge, the Hotel Gellért, the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden.[104]\n\nIt is one of the world's outstanding urban landscapes and illustrates the great periods in the history of the Hungarian capital.\n\nUNESCO[119]\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of blocks of flats (panelház), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force Budapest to balance between them. The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city. Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square, Deák Ferenc square and Liberty Square. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest, like the National Theatre, Palace of Arts, Rákóczi Bridge, Megyeri Bridge, Budapest Airport Sky Court among others, and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments. But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city.[120][121][122]", "response": "Gothic; Renaissance;  Ottoman; Baroque;  Classical; Neoclassical; Contemporary", "category": "information_extraction"}

While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite. There is a delicious amount of complexity in every bite: a crunch, warm, maybe a little spice, a little sweet from the tomato sauce and of course added complexities from whichever toppings you choose.

{"instruction": "You have been placed in the position of supporting the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.  Please develop your position into a one-page position paper (12-point font, single spaced).", "context": "", "response": "The Citizens United case is ultimately one pertaining to freedom of speech—while undeniable to US citizens, the protection of free speech was previously denied to unions and corporations. Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.\nBut, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals – which companies are – and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)\nBut the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.\nCitizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "Define Part of Speech", "context": "", "response": "In grammar, a part of speech or part-of-speech (abbreviated as POS or PoS, also known as word class or grammatical category) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties.

{"instruction": "What makes a good teacher?", "context": "", "response": "Throughout history ‘what makes a good teacher?’ has constantly been questioned by both parents and children. Many consider a good teacher to be one who is caring, helpful, yet also strict when necessary. \n One book that focuses on what makes a good teacher is Our day out, by Willy Russel. The book provided people in the 1970s with a perspective on what both children and parents were looking for, inspiring many British teachers. According to Russel, a good teacher cares for the learning of their students and demonstrates it. If a teacher does not demonstrate caring behavior, their students will sense it. Carol, one of the students says to Mr.Briggs “Don't lie, you! I know you hate me. I've seen you goin' home in your car, passin' us on the street. You hate all the kids.” (Russell 48). Carol believes that Mr. Briggs does not care about his students, even though he does as shown earlier in the book: “Briggs: What? About you? Listen ... if I didn't care, why am I here, now, trying to stop you doing something stupid.” (Russell 48). Mr Briggs believes that caring for students implies also disciplining them at times. “Listen, I'm not going to spend any more time arguing with you. You may have organized this visit, but I'm the one who's been sent by the Headmaster to supervise. Now, either you take control of the children in your charge or I'll be forced to abandon this visit and order everyone home.” Thus, even if a teacher cares about their students, they should demonstrate it. Opinions from students of different ages will help further illustrate the image of a good teacher. \nMany people think that a good teacher is primarily kind and loving.  However, through multiple interviews it appeared to be only partially true. A good teacher, according to most students, is not overly kind and should apply discipline when needed. For example, 12 year old Monon Mukherjee said that he looks for guidance and ability to teach in a teacher. On the other hand, 40 year old Bilal Aslam looks for discipline and ability to teach. 42 year old Cristian Molina also agrees with the need for discipline, however he also expects teachers to feel an urge to help students no matter who they are. The book and the interviews intersect in many ways. They both highlight the importance of kindness, caring for learning, and teacher’s ability to discipline. However, they also differ in important ways. In the book, teachers were encouraged to be kind and apply discipline when necessary, but through the interviews it has been shown that providing help and guidance are also expected in a good teacher.\nIn conclusion, a good teacher cares about their students' learning, is prepared to help them, yet also disciplines them when necessary. A good teacher should feel an urge to teach students and guide them through the complex path of life.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "what is Modern Talking?", "context": "Modern Talking was a German pop music duo consisting of arranger, songwriter and producer Dieter Bohlen[5] and singer Thomas Anders. They have been referred to as Germany's most successful pop duo,[6] and have had a number of hit singles, reaching the top five in many countries. Their most popular singles are \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", \"You Can Win If You Want\", \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\", \"Brother Louie\", \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\" and \"Geronimo's Cadillac\".\nModern Talking worked together from 1983 to 1987, then the band disbanded. In 1998, they reunited and made a successful comeback, recording and releasing music from 1998 to 2003. The duo released singles (many of which involved American rapper Eric Singleton) which again entered the top ten in Germany and abroad, one of which was the re-recorded version of \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98\". After the duo's second and final break-up in 2003, their global sales had reached 120 million singles and albums combined.", "response": "First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks,[3][8][9] the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide.[5] The track was then followed by another number-one hit, \"You Can Win If You Want\", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.[5][10]\n\nSoon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands.[11][12] The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000.[5][10] The success continued with another two number one singles, \"Brother Louie\" and \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and \"Jet Airliner\" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.\n\nDue to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles.[13] This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings,[14] a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography.[13] After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.[13][14]\n\nDuring this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song \"Brother Louie\".[15] In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts.[16] They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.[17]\n\nNotably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.[18]\n\nBetween 1987 and 1997\nImmediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like \"Sorry Little Sarah\", \"My Bed Is Too Big\", \"Under My Skin\", \"Love Suite\", \"Laila\" and \"Déjà vu\". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country.[19] Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal.[20] He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.[20]\n\n1998–2003: Reunion\nIn the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries,[17] eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone.[21] The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.[21]\n\nBohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide,[17] Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation.[22] The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003.[22] In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS.", "category": "summarization"}

You are this carefree soul, who laughs out loud, makes weird faces and noises, showers loads of kisses and hugs, danced like no one is seeing, talked in a cute weird way, which only you and the audience would understand. \nOn a rainy day, everything you touch could go wrong. Your anger will see its waves. Your voice is commanding and demanding. Your eyes spew anger. Every action of yours is wrong till you sit and calm yourself and analyse what you are going through and why. \nAs much as you want to get it over, the more it will haunt you in your later years. You will long for those happy moments, those hugs and kisses, where everything under the sun was perfect and just like how you had envisioned, but it is all gone. Those are now just thoughts you keep revisiting, hoping you could time travel back to those golden days", "category": "creative_writing"}

To be successful will require a lot of discipline and hard work. Here is one potential path which you may consider: \n\n1) Improve you general fitness: In order to become a successful MMA athlete you need to have good general fitness. This can include things like strength training, yoga (flexibility) and cardio (swimming, running, etc). \n\n2) Get a breadth of experience: It is helpful to get competency in the various specialties that are found in MMA fights so you can adequately handle all styles that may be employed at the time.  At a high level, this can be split into two sections: \n    - Striking: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training is Boxing, Kickboxing, Muai-Thai. \n    - Grappling: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training in is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, Freestyle Wresting. \n\n3) Consider specializing: While it is good to have a breadth of different techniques, really honing in on one sub-discipline can give you an edge in comparison to other fighters. For example, Khabib Nurmagomedov has found success with a wrestling base. \n\n\nThese are just some starting points to consider when thinking about becoming a professional MMA athlete.

The Republicans were split, with progressive Republicans in support but conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic and stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The film also features Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, Cameron's direction, musical score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark.

{"instruction": "Is it wrong to split the infinitive?", "context": "", "response": "First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?", "category": "open_qa"}

Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is always held at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private course in the city of Augusta, Georgia, in the southeastern United States.\n\nThe Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts.[4] After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie.[1] First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket).[5] The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson.

A versatile and well-rounded attacker, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimović is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilize his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates. While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimović is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimović is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the moniker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimović possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills. Although he is not gifted with exceptional pace, in particular over shorter distances, which became more evident in his later career as he slowed down with age, he is also a quick player and a fast sprinter, who possessed significant acceleration in his youth, and was able to clock top speeds over 30 km/h even into his 30s.", "category": "classification"}
{"instruction": "Extract from the following passage, the periods of time does sunrise refer to.", "context": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.", "response": "Astronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon.

What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom.

{"instruction": "What is the objective of a batter in the sport of baseball?", "context": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).\n\nThe principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.\n\nThe opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of \"America's Pastime\"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.", "response": "The principal objective of the batting team in the sport of baseball is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach.

{"instruction": "Who built Sigiriya fortress in Sri Lanka?", "context": "It is likely that the area around Sigiriya may have been inhabited since prehistoric times. There is clear evidence that the many rock shelters and caves in the vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and ascetics from as early as the 3rd century BC. The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that the area was occupied nearly five thousand years ago during the Mesolithic Period.\n\nBuddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BC in the western and northern slopes of the boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. These shelters were made under large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences. These were made in the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century AD.\n\nIn 477 AD, Kashyapa I, the king’s son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup assisted by Migara, the King’s nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled to South India. Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa’s reign (477 to 495 AD), Sigiriya was developed into a complex city and fortress.[3][4] Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it, including defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date from this period.", "response": "King Kashyapa developed Sigiriya city and fortress.", "category": "closed_qa"}
