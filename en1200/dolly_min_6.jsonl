Given that pB is usually 0, the equation becomes R=-C +D and in order for the R to be a positive value (which means a citizen will vote), we need civic duty to “outweigh” the cost of voting. \nThe Rational Choice model has two competing views on how voters choose to vote.  One is proximity voting.  In this case, the voter chooses the candidate that they are the closest to in terms of where that candidate sits on a liberal/conservative line.  The other view is directional voting, which says the voter will vote for whomever is on their “side” of the scale.  For example, a Republican would vote for a Republican candidate even if they are closer to the Democratic candidate on the scale.", "category": "general_qa"}

As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.  As thrust increases and pulls the plane forward, the lift eventually increases enough to overcome the weight and drag and the airplane will take flight.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "Wthat is the difference between Speed and Velocity ?", "context": "", "response": "Speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60 miles per hour, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 miles per hour to the north, its velocity has now been specified.\n\nThe big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed considers only the total distance travelled.", "category": "open_qa"}

Since anti-pathogen inhibitors generally target only one enzyme, such drugs are highly specific and generally produce few side effects in humans. \n\nMedicinal enzyme inhibitors often have low dissociation constants, meaning a minute amount of the inhibitor will inhibit the enzyme.

{"instruction": "What is epistatis?", "context": "", "response": "Epistasis is a phenomenon in genetics in which the effect of a gene mutation is dependent on the presence or absence of mutations in one or more other genes, respectively termed modifier genes. In other words, the effect of the mutation is dependent on the genetic background in which it appears. Epistatic mutations therefore have different effects on their own than when they occur together. Originally, the term epistasis specifically meant that the effect of a gene variant is masked by that of a different gene.\n\nThe concept of epistasis originated in genetics in 1907 but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. The phenomenon arises due to interactions, either between genes (such as mutations also being needed in regulators of gene expression) or within them (multiple mutations being needed before the gene loses function), leading to non-linear effects. Epistasis has a great influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and for the evolvability of phenotypic traits.", "category": "open_qa"}

As you are hitting a bump, you want to keep your back as straight as possible and let your hip and knee take the impact. The movement pattern is similar to squatting down, where you want to drop your bottom down towards your ankle. The reason you want your knee and hip to take the impact is because those joints have much bigger range of motion compared to your back so as you hit a bump or mogul, those joints will help absorb the majority of the irregularity in the terrain so your back is not needing to move as much which will help reduce the strain being put on it.", "category": "creative_writing"}

The increased rates make lending more expensive, and subsequently discourages capital investment and borrowing. The added cost in turn reduces demand for products and services. Lower demand normally leads to dropping prices to try and motivate potential buyers. The other primary method involves open-market operations.

It is updated every year.\n- The Human Freedom Index is developed by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in the United States. It is a global ranking that uses ranks countries according to their levels of personal, civil and economic freedom.\n\nIn any case, it depends on what do you understand by \"freedom\", and also what you want to compare among the different countries.", "category": "general_qa"}

As technology advances, new innovations are made and cyclical market segments ebb and flow, the demand for highly skilled workers changes.  Upskilling is important as it helps workers to maintain valuable skills in their given field and the goal is to keep up with the technology advances in their respective field.  Reskilling is most often more closely linked to cyclical market forces where the demand for jobs in one field go down and another go up; reskilling is acquiring skills in the field with growing demand for jobs when a worker possesses skills in a field with declining demand for jobs or their skills.", "category": "open_qa"}
