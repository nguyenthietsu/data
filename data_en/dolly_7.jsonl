{"instr": "Summarize the four basic principles of GAAP accounting", "ctxt": "To achieve basic objectives and implement fundamental qualities, GAAP has four basic assumptions, four basic principles, and four basic constraints.\n\nAssumptions\nBusiness Entity: assumes that the business is separate from its owners or other businesses. Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "response": "The four basic principles of GAAP accounting are:\n1. Historical Cost Principle: Accounting and reporting assets and liabilities acquisition costs instead of their fair market value\n2. Revenue Recognition Principle: Record revenue when earned instead of received\n3. Matching Principle: Expenses must be matched with revenues\n4. Full Disclosure Principle: The amount of information disclosed must be based on a trade-off analysis between cost and transparency", "catgr": "smzt"}

{"instr": "Bioinformatics", "ctxt": "", "response": "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret the biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using computational and statistical techniques.\n\nBioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as specific analysis \"pipelines\" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim to better understand the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called proteomics.\n\nImage and signal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the text mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in comparing, analyzing and interpreting genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology. In structural biology, it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA, proteins as well as biomolecular interactions.", "catgr": "opqa"}

This was further solidified by the creation of the Berlin wall and the Soviet supported Communist governments that ruled over eastern European countries throughout the cold war. After the collapse of Soviet Union, the iron curtain disappeared as many eastern European countries topped their Communist governments and joined the Western sphere of influence.", "catgr": "opqa"}

Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.\n\nAI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[1]\n\nAs machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[2] having become a routine technology.[3]\n\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism,[4][5] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"),[6][7] followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding.[5][8] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.[8][9]\n\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[10] To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\n\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[b] This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.[12] Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.[c] The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.[13][14][15]", "response": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines rather than Intelligence of species and this AI is being used in some application like  advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving car, generative or creative tools but like every coin has two face AI also raise ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence", "catgr": "smzt"}

In addition to extraction equipment, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges to find more reservoir area, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities.\n\nOil fields can occur anywhere that the geology of the underlying rock allows, meaning that certain fields can be far away from civilization, including at sea.

This infrastructure has to be designed with the lifespan of the oil field in mind, as production can last many years.

{"instr": "Is black hole truly black?", "ctxt": "A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.", "response": "According to general relativity, a black hole emits no lights at all.

{"instr": "Based on the following passage where did plums, apricots and peaches originate?", "ctxt": "Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "Plums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia.

{"instr": "Monster Hunter 4 Unlimited (hereafter, \"MH4U\") was a video game released exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS circa 2013. Elden Ring was a video game released for multiple platforms in circa 2022 to critical acclaim. \n\nIf MH4U and Elden Ring were considered to be siblings nine years apart in a small family, how might the experiences of MH4U have influenced the growth and development of Elden Ring?", "ctxt": "", "response": "Young parents face many challenges. Finances, education, and home expenses often compete with the needs of a growing family. Within the context provided, MH4U reflects the first child of a young couple who must make several investments, including clothing, baby essentials, and furniture.  This may be conveyed under the limited system resources available to MH4U under the 3DS console: 128MB of RAM. Additionally, one or both parents may work full time, leaving limited time to work with and grow the child. As the child, MH4U,  enters age 9, they should be entering 4th or 5th grade and have developed the cognitive and functional skills to support their parents. Additionally, the parents will have likely developed further in their careers and caretaking abilities that ensure the stability and growth of a small family. In this example, Elden Ring represents the second child, which arrives nine years after MH4U. In this context, as a result of the growth of experience and income of the family, and assuming the family equates to a Playstation 4, the family now enjoys 8GB of RAM.\n\nAs described in the preceding paragraph, the familial environment that Elden Ring emerges from is vastly different than that of MH4U. However, there are additional benefits beyond the system limitations provided. These benefits are conveyed through the emotional and physical support provided through familial bonds, in this case, that of an older and younger sibling. Upon the arrival of Elden Ring, MH4U is eager to help their parents with caretaking tasks which may include keeping the child company, completing small jobs and errands, and establishing familial bonds with their sibling. The parents will be able to draw upon the experience of raising MH4U and apply those lessons to their newest member of the family. It\u2019s important that the parents continue to create small jobs for MH4U that help to convey positive responses to younger family members: caretaking, guidance, and companionship. \n\nAs MH4U graduates from their teens and enters early adulthood, it\u2019s critical that they stay actively involved in the life of their sibling. By age 18, MH4U will now be nine years older than Elden Ring, which as it happens, is the same age when MH4U became an older sibling. Under this lens, MH4U carries greater social responsibility than they did when they were the same age as Elden Ring. MH4U may also begin to contemplate leaving the family for continuing education. While it\u2019s common for individuals to depart the family for secondary education after age 18, it\u2019s critically important that MH4U continue to maintain constant contact with its younger sibling to provide guidance and advice and convey lessons learned from its formative experiences.  \n\nIn this way, Elden Ring has a fast track to develop. MH4U is able to provide guidance equatable to best practices, experiences, and trial and error. Additionally, MH4U development during constrained resources encourages Elden Ring to do \u201cmore with less\u201d and ensures a fastidious approach towards the allocation of resources. By the time Elden Ring approaches age 18, they enjoy the combined experiences of their parents and their older sibling which helps to increase their likelihood of success and families are stronger when they provide guidance and stability to their children.\n\nIn summary, the success of Elden Ring was no accident. The investments of the parents into the older sibling, MH4U, however lacking, provided a baseline level by which MH4U could invest in its younger sibling Elden Ring. Through this chain of investments, the family finds a greater chance of success. Under the lens of the original context, there would not be a critically reception to Elden Ring had not the parents made baseline investment and support to MH4U during the formative years of the family.", "catgr": "gqa"}

Despite this, the fanbase for the Kings remained loyal and regularly attended games to watch their team lose year after year. In the midst of this drought, the previous owners of the franchise attempted to move the team to a new city, with significant traction at various points, to both Anaheim and Seattle. It was only the passion of the fans, and the combined support from local businesses and politicians, that prevented the move. In addition to the Kings having one of the most supportive fanbases in the NBA getting their first taste of success, the Kings are also a highly enjoyable team to watch. The players are friendly and likable, and the offense is one of the most successful in NBA history. Lastly, the team also has a fun gimmick of lighting a large purple laser beam that can be seen for miles after every victory, leading to a chorus of 'Light the beam!' from the Kings fanbase in the arena at the conclusion of every win.

{"instr": "How does the time of sunrise vary from spring to summer?", "ctxt": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.", "response": "In late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude.

{"instr": "How does grain orientation effect the dimensional movement of wood?", "ctxt": "", "response": "Wood expands and shrinks depending on its moisture content.  The relative amount of change, expansion, or shrinkage differs for each of the three main grain directions.  Those directions are longitudinal, radial, and tangential.  Longitudinal is the direction a tree or its branches grows length-wise.  In most lumber, this is its length.  The change in this direction is very small.  That is why a wooden ruler can be used without changing its measurements when ambient moisture changes.  In almost all uses, longitudinal expansion and contraction are small enough not to be of concern.  Radial and tangential directional expansion and contraction are significant and different enough that they affect the dimensional stability of a piece of wood.  The relative amount of change in each direction is specific to the wood species.  Regardless of wood species, the change is greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction.  The tangential direction is tangential to the growth rings in the wood, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the growth rings.  The T/R or ratio of tangential to radial change correlates to the dimensional stability of a wood species.  If you visualize a piece of lumber that is milled square and comes from a part of a log such that the rings are almost straight across in one direction, that is referred to as vertical grain or quarter sawn.  As the moisture content of the wood changes to come into equilibrium with its environment, it will move toward a diamond shape.  The closer the T/R ratio is to 1, the less the square dimension will distort. Dimensional stability and the direction of wood movement is important to plan for when cutting joinery in wood.  If two joined pieces are aligned so that they will not move in the same direction relative to the joint, the joint will be unstable when the ambient humidity changes and can cause the joint to fail.", "catgr": "gqa"}

Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall. Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.\n\nFascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition. Belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist; the term is more often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes employed to describe contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements. \n\nThe first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently bad and views imperialism, political violence and war as means to national rejuvenation.

For example, meatballs are relatively inexpensive, widely enjoyed, and easy to be kept warm in crockpot. Items like chicken wings are popular for many of the same reasons. Salads are also a good choice because they don not need to be kept hot. Items that require immediate serving are typically avoided because the dishes need to be prepared, then travel to the locality of the event, and as such create logistical and quality problems.

Depending on the time of year that they visit, different options would rank higher. \nFor example, if they arrive in the warmer months, say May to September, then an excellent place to start would be the freedom trail. This is a marked track that follows the famous ride of Paul Revere as the British forces arrived in Massachusetts Bay prior to the war of independence. During the warmer months, this path is nice to walk along as it will take your family along the landmarks of Boston, through the Boston Common, past the Quincy Markets, the Bunker Hill memorial, and through Boston's North End where some of the best Italian restaurants in the country can be found. In addition to this, Boston is home to two of the most prestigious universities in the world, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Free walking tours are available on both of these campuses which are located on the other side of the Charles river in the city of Cambridge. You can also go to a baseball game at the famous Fenway Park stadium to see the local team, the Red Socks play, as well as enjoy the city's shopping district along Newbury St. and the Prudential. \nIf, however, your family visits in the colder season, or worse during the peak of winter, Boston still has plenty of fun and enjoyable activities. You could take them to an ice hockey game at TD Gardens to watch the local team, the Bruins play. There are also Christmas and winter markets in the Sea Port district throughout the holidays.

He was the first person to hold the office of vice president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important contemporaries, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams as well as his friend and rival Thomas Jefferson.\n\nA lawyer and political activist prior to the Revolution, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre. Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a leader of the revolution. He assisted Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate a peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States constitution, as did his essay Thoughts on Government.\n\nAdams was elected to two terms as vice president under President George Washington and was elected as the United States' second president in 1796. He was the only president elected under the banner of the Federalist Party. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared naval war (called the \"Quasi-War\") with France. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the White House.\n\nIn his bid in 1800 for reelection to the presidency, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Jeffersonians led to Adams losing to his vice president and former friend Jefferson, and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated the Adams political family, a line of politicians, diplomats, and historians. It includes their son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president. John Adams died on July 4, 1826 \u2013 the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence \u2013 hours after Jefferson's death.

{"instr": "Based on the following passage describe the first solid-state device and its use.", "ctxt": "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "The first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers.

Base sizes going from 15 inches per side to 18 inches per side. The increase in base size promotes safer stealing conditions for runners allowing them to more easily avoid contact with fielders. Also, the larger base surface area will help runners from \"over-sliding\" on the base leading to an out.\n\n2. Two disengagements per plate appearance. Pitchers are only allowed two forms of disengagement which will reduce the number of pickoff attempts and mound step offs. In the event of a third disengagement, the pitcher will be charged with a balk leading to a base advancement for any runner on base or a ball given to the batter.\n\n3. Eliminating the shift. When the time a pitch is thrown, all four infielders must be on the infield dirt or grass with two on each side of second base.

{"instr": "What are some important points about the Battle of the Bulge?", "ctxt": "The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II. The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg. It overlapped with the Alsace Offensive, subsequently the Colmar Pocket, another series of battles launched by the Germans in support of the Ardennes thrust.\n\nThe primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces. The Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who since December 1941 had assumed direct command of the German army,[18] believed that achieving these objectives would compel the Western Allies to accept a peace treaty in the Axis powers' favor. By this time, it was palpable to virtually the entire German leadership including Hitler himself that they had no realistic hope of repelling the imminent Soviet invasion of Germany unless the Wehrmacht was able to concentrate the entirety of its remaining forces on the Eastern Front, which in turn obviously required that hostilities on the Western and Italian Fronts be terminated. The Battle of the Bulge remains among the most important battles of the war, as it marked the last major offensive attempted by the Axis Powers on the Western front. After their defeat, Germany would retreat for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies' superior air forces. Fierce American resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This congestion, and terrain that favored the defenders, threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops.\n\nThe farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944.[19] Improved weather conditions from around 24 December permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege. Although the offensive was effectively broken by 27 December, when the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts with only partial success, the battle continued for another month before the front line was effectively restored to its position prior to the attack. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were out of men and equipment, and the survivors retreated to the Siegfried Line.\n\nThe Germans' initial attack involved around 410,000 men; just over 1,400 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns; 2,600 artillery pieces; and over 1,000 combat aircraft, as well as large numbers of other armored fighting vehicles (AFVs).[20] These were reinforced a couple of weeks later, bringing the offensive's total strength to around 450,000 troops, and 1,500 tanks and assault guns. Between 63,222 and 103,900 of these men were killed, missing, wounded in action, or captured. The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war. German Luftwaffe personnel, and later also Luftwaffe aircraft (in the concluding stages of the engagement) also sustained heavy losses.\n\nFrom among the Americans' peak strength of 610,000 troops there were 75,500 battle casualties, including about 8,400 killed.[21] The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II[22][23][24] and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.", "response": "\u2022 The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II.\n\u2022 The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe.\n\u2022 The primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces.\n\u2022 The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather.\n\u2022 The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944.\n\u2022 On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege.\n\u2022 The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war.\n\u2022 The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.", "catgr": "smzt"}

The statue had an inscription identifying it as an image of Helios, the god of the sun and local deity to Rhodes. In the wider Ancient Greek world Helios would likely be identified more readily as Apollo. The statue may have been made in the likeness of Alexander the Great's official image. This would have served to represent a bond between Rhodes and Alexandria with Alexander's image serving as the founder of the Egyptian city. Support for this idea comes from the fact that the Colossus was made to celebrate Rhodes' victory over a siege. This victory was largely facilitated by Ptolemy from Alexandria, and Alexandria is also a likely source for the funds of the ambitious project. The artist Chares of Lindos would also have been well selected to achieve this double representation. He was local to the island of Rhodes (Lindos is another city on the same island) and would have been familiar with images of Helios. He was also the student of Lysippos who was the exclusive personal sculptor to Alexander the Great during his lifetime, and so Chares would have also been uniquely knowledgeable about the image of Alexander. Some but not all scholars argue for the Colossus to be understood as an image of Alexander posing as Helios that would be seen by the people of Rhodes as their local deity but seen by the people of Alexandria as their founder. The Statue of Liberty built by France and gifted to the USA was partially modeled after the Colossus and is similarly possible to read as a celebration of American independence and also a reference to one the three values Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9 and Fraternit\u00e9 central to French identity.", "catgr": "gqa"}

{"instr": "Based on the following paragraph on water, what makes water cohesive.", "ctxt": "Life arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago.[31] Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life.[31] In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O).[31] Because the O\u2013H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge.[31] This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive.[31] Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid.[31] Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules.[31] Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice).[31] This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above.[31] Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol.[31] Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor.[31] As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again.[31] In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.", "response": "Water is made cohesive due to its polar property which allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds.", "catgr": "cloqa"}

{"instr": "How do you reverse sear a steak on the Big Green Egg?", "ctxt": "", "response": "How to reverse Sear? The reverse sear is one of the most popular ways to grill a steak on the Big Green Egg, and my personal favorite. The key to the Reverse Sear is to start low and slow. It is much easier to raise the temp on the BGE than lower the temp. Ideally, the dome temp for a reverse sear is 250. However, I've had good success with the temp as low as 225 and as high as 300. \n\nFill your BGE up with your favorite lump charcoal up to the fire ring , light the fire and let it burn for about 9 minutes. Stir the coals so that the lit coals mix with unlit coals for an even cook.I prefer to cook my steak without adding wood chips as I don't want to overpower the meat...but if I were going to add chips I prefer post oak. Put the plate setter in with the legs up. Close the top and open the bottom vent and top vent with the opening about the size of a quarter. With the plate setter in, give it about 30 minutes to heat up the plate setter and stabilize at 250.\n\nNow that the Egg is stabilized at 250, time to add your steaks. You can pretty much reverse sear almost any cut but I prefer a ribeye, strip, or filet. The quintessential reverse sear cut is the bone-in ribeye, aka the cowboy or Tomahawk. The reverse sear works best with thick cuts. I would say the minimum thickness for a reverse sear is about 1 and a half inch, but the thicker the better. I look for the thickest cut possible for best results. I personally prefer to season my steaks with salt and pepper. My theory is that if you just spent $50 on a prime steak, then no need to overpower the meat with fancy seasoning. I want like the steaks to speak for themselves. The key to this stage is a good leave in thermometer. You want to roast the steaks until internal temp hits 113 degrees.  No more no less. When the internal temp hits 113, remove your steak to a cutting board and tent with foil.\n\t\nAt this point you should have pulled the steak with an internal temp of 113, and it should be resting on a tented cutting board. Final step of the reverse sear is the sear. Open up the top and remove the plate setter and grates.Open the bottom vent all the way and let the oxygen in to stoke the fire. I will give the coals another stir and about 5 minutes with the top open to gas up the fire. I then replace the grate, close the top and open all vents. The dome temp should climb rapidly. For a good sear you want it at least 450, with the ideal dome temp about 500-550. At this point you need to make a choice. You can either sear directly over the coals, or you can use a cast iron skillet with a butter bath. if you are going directly over the coals, its pretty simple. Place the steaks on the grate, and sear for about 90 seconds per side. If you use a cast iron skillet, I use a 50/50 mix of salted butter and olive oil. Butter has a lower scorch point, so if your skillet gets too hot you will burn the butter. I've also had good success with Avocado or Peanut oil that has a much higher scorch point. Add some garlic and thyme, sear for 90 seconds a side and don't forget to spoon the butter over the steaks for a little extra love. Remove the steaks and let them rest for 10 minutes. This is a critical step that will ensure the juices will stay in the meat.\n\nSlice and serve.", "catgr": ""cwt"}

This approach was eventually discarded as too limiting, and the qualifiers were dropped. Martin and Woltz Inc. eventually gained prominence and grew to become The Martin Agency.[4] The Martin Agency says that, contrary to some claims, the slogan is not a reference to the United States Supreme Court's 1967 ruling in Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage in the United States.[5]\n\nIn 1969, the Virginia State Travel Service (now the Virginia Tourism Corporation) adopted the \"Virginia is for Lovers\" slogan and the first ad campaign using the tagline appeared in March 1969, in an issue of Modern Bride.[4]\n\nIn 2009, \"Virginia is for Lovers\" was inducted into the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame, a creation of Advertising Week, the largest collection of advertising, marketing and media professionals in North America.

In 2005, post-hardcore band Hawthorne Heights alluded to the phrase in the title of their single \u201cOhio Is for Lovers,\u201d which would become widely regarded as an anthem of the early 2000\u2019s emo music scene.[7] American Idol winner Jordin Sparks recorded a song called \"Virginia is for Lovers\" in 2007, which was featured as a bonus track on her self-titled debut album. The slogan is mentioned in The Hold Steady song \"Killer Parties\", and Willie Adler, guitarist for Lamb of God, has the slogan printed on the neck of his custom guitars. The slogan is also mentioned in the Kenny Chesney song \"Get Along\". Virginia Beach-based rap group Clipse include the slogan in their song \"Virginia,\" from their 2002 album Lord Willin', proclaiming: \"Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here / For out-of-towners, who think they're gon' move weight here.\"", "response": "- \"Virginia is for Lovers\" is a tourism and travel slogan adopted by the Virginia State Travel Service (now the Virginia Tourism Corporation) since 1969\n- The \"lovers\" in the slogan was originally attached to qualifiers such as history lovers, beach lovers, and mountain lovers.

One of the most significant changes is the decrease in muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass is known as sarcopenia and can start as early as age 30, with a more rapid decline after age 60. This may lead many people to believe that gaining muscle after 35 is impossible, but is that really the case?\nYes, it's possible to build muscle after 35\n\nThe short answer is yes, it is possible to build muscle after 35. In fact, strength training can be just as effective for older adults as it is for younger ones. It's never too late to start working on your fitness goals and building the body you want.\n\nThe benefits of building muscle after 35\n\nAs we age, building muscle becomes increasingly important for several reasons. First and foremost, it can help us maintain our independence and mobility as we age. Strong muscles can help us with everyday activities like carrying groceries or getting up from a chair. Building muscle can also help prevent injuries and falls, which can be more dangerous as we get older.\n\nAdditionally, building muscle can help improve our overall health. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, which means it burns more calories at rest. This can help us maintain a healthy weight and lower our risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\nHow to build muscle after 35\n\nSo, how exactly do you go about building muscle after 35? The key is to focus on strength training exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses are great for building overall strength and muscle mass.\nIt's also important to gradually increase the weight and intensity of your workouts over time. This will help you continue to make progress and avoid plateauing. Additionally, be sure to give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts.\n\nFinally, proper nutrition is crucial for building muscle at any age. Make sure you're getting enough protein, as this is essential for muscle growth and repair. Aim for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.\n\nBuilding muscle after 35 is definitely possible, and it comes with a variety of benefits. Strength training can help improve our overall health, prevent injury, and maintain our independence as we age. The key is to focus on compound exercises, gradually increase the intensity of your workouts, and make sure you're getting enough protein. So, what are you waiting for?

{"instr": "What type of toilets do RVs have?", "ctxt": "", "response": "There are three main types of toilets found in RVs, with some rarer options available. Most RVs work off a \u201ctank\u201d system, with sink and shower water going into the \u201cgray\u201d tank and toilet waste going into the \u201cblack\u201d tank. These tanks then need to be emptied on a regular basis dependent on their capacity. Toilets that work with a tank system tend to work like residential toilets, but use less water and have a foot pedal for flushing. There are two other types of toilets found often in DIY conversion RVs or \u201coff-grid\u201d RVs. First, cassette toilets are essentially holding tanks for toilet waste that are then pulled out of the RV and manually emptied. The \u201ccassette\u201d portion of the toilet is often on wheels, and can be emptied at either a dump station or in a public toilet. Composting toilets are the final common toilet type found in RVs. Composting toilets are a \u201cdry\u201d toilet, where waste goes into a holding tank with a composting material and becomes compost. The compost mixture must be stirred occasionally, but composting toilets often need to be emptied less often.

Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon.[21] Cage, however, would co-star in Coppola's adaptation of another Hinton novel, Rumble Fish, in that year.[22]\n\nIn 1984, Cage appeared in three period films, none of which fared well at the box office.

The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of video game consoles and available games, many of which were of poor quality, as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Home video game revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. To a lesser extent, the arcade video game market also weakened as the golden age of arcade video games came to an end.\n\nLasting about two years, the crash shook a then-booming video game industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software.\n\nThe North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of Nintendo's Western branding for its Famicom console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in 1985. The NES was designed to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and the stigma associated with video games at that time.", "response": "Home video game revenues in North America declined from $3.2 billion in 1983 to around $100 million in 1985.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "response": "Companies pre-announce their future products because of the following reasons:\n1. to reassure current customers that their product is improving\n2. to comfort current customers that a lower cost model of their is coming\n2. to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects\n3. to intimidate or confuse competitors", "catgr":"infet"}

Carl is a good husband to point out that she needs to fulfill her \"Things I am going to do\" promise to herself, but does not realize how Ellie views the loss of the baby.\n\nCarl is stuck on the aspect of having the house on Paradise island. He thinks that Ellie never lived her adventures and never added to her book since her first wish never got fulfilled. \n\nWhen an adventure presents itself in the form of Kevin, Carl, still attached to the past, prefers to fulfill the perceived wish by Ellie. When he does get the home on the water fall, it is clear that he is not satisfied. He can say that the dog nor Kevin are his problems. But when he sits down in his beloved chair, and looks through Ellie book of adventure again, he realizes that Ellie lived her adventures. She had no regrets. Her life was an adventure. And just at the right time, Carl sees the message from her to live his own adventure, i.e. Kevin.\n\nThings become clearer for Carl. He is absolved of his guilt. He realizes that Ellie never felt bad about not being able to have her home on Paradise island. This moment of clarity is what all humans crave for.

Yes you have dreams. But in day to day life, those dreams may not be achieved. Look for adventure. Look to live fully and without attachment to your dreams like Ellie did.

The products are required to have fire-resistance ratings and to be used in accordance with a certification listing.\n\nThere are three types of firestop pillows:[citation needed]\n\nrockwool batts with intumescent resin inside plastic bags\nvermiculite with intumescent graphite inside of fibreglass bags\nintumescent foam rubber\nThe intumescent resins in batt-based firestop pillows contains hydrates, or chemically bound water. On the fire side, the plastic bag burns off exposing the intumescent to the fire, which releases the water in the form of vapour or steam. The steam rises and hits the plastic bag interior on the unexposed side, where it condenses back to water, and runs back down to cool the installation below. Batt-based pillows are held in place by compressing them, allowing friction to restrain them.\n\nThe vermiculite fabric bag and the graphite are noncombustible.

Ensure you have water or another way to extinguish your fire readily available. Use a campfire ring, pit, or clear a large area around your campfire location. Also, make sure campfires are permitted in your area. \n\nWith safety out of the way, all a fire needs are heat, fuel, and oxygen. Any combustible material will start a fire, but good campfire fuel sources include tinder, kindling, and dry logs.\n\nUse stuff like dry pine needles, dry leaves, grasses, and wood shavings for tinder. You could also use newspaper (or any paper), dryer lint, or cardboard. For kindling, use smaller pieces of wood, such as twigs and sticks no thicker than 1 inch in diameter (about the thickness of your thumb). Dry or well-seasoned logs will ensure a good burn. Stack the wood in a way that guarantees oxygen can easily reach your flame. Many prefer a teepee or log cabin stacking design. Now, use a heat source to create a flame or spark and apply this to your tinder. Once the tinder combusts, it should light the kindling, and the kindling should eventually ignite your logs.

{"instr": "Is Moore's law still viable?", "ctxt": "Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel (and former CEO of the latter), who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit,[a] and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. While Moore did not use empirical evidence in forecasting that the historical trend would continue, his prediction held since 1975 and has since become known as a \"law\". Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth. Industry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when Moore's law will cease to apply. Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, slightly below the pace predicted by Moore's law. In September 2022 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang considered Moore's law dead, while Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was of the opposite view.", "response": "Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a circuit doubles about every two years.

As a recreational drone pilot you can capture and immortalize the incredible views experienced in nature while engaging in many outdoor activities. Many also engage in racing and building highly customized high speed drones using first person view (FPV) goggles to fly against other pilots in a close loop course. Before engaging in this fun and rewarding activity there are many rules that a drone pilot must be aware of in order to safely and legally operate your drone. These rules do not apply to racing drones in sanctioned races but do apply to all drones flown in public airspace.  All drones over 0.55lbs or 250g need to be registered through the FAA website and can not weigh over 55lbs.  If you plan to fly your drone over highly populated areas such as towns, sporting events, or concerts you will need to check local rules and ordinances that require special local licensing, insurance, or approvals.  Many higher end drones come with automated software that provides a geospatial mapping software in their interface that lets you know if you are flying in any restricted areas.  These include airports, helipads, government facilities, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.  All hobbyist drone pilots must follow two main rules.  You can never fly above 400 feet and regardless of range you must keep the drone within line of sight.  You are completely responsible for any damage your drone causes in the event of loss of control that results in a crash.  Lastly, use common sense and don\u2019t invade others' personal space or to invade others\u2019 personal privacy.

The order, however, never recovered their former power, and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands controlled by them. The battle shifted the balance of power in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian union as the dominant regional political and military force.[8]\n\nThe battle was one of the largest in medieval Europe.[9] The battle is viewed as one of the most important victories in the histories of Poland and Lithuania.

A typical classroom serves 20 to 30 children in mixed-age groups, staffed by a fully trained lead teacher and assistants. Classrooms are usually outfitted with child-sized tables and chairs arranged singly or in small clusters, with classroom materials on child-height shelves throughout the room. Activities are for the most part initially presented by the teacher, after which they may be chosen more or less freely by the children as interest dictates. A teacher's role within a Montessori classroom is to guide and consult students individually by letting each child create their own learning pathway. Classroom materials usually include activities for engaging in practical skills such as pouring and spooning, washing up, scrubbing tables and sweeping. Also materials for the development of the senses, mathematical materials, language materials, music, art and cultural materials, including more science-based activities like 'sink and float', Magnetic and Non magnetic and candle and air.[17]\n\nActivities in Children's Houses are typically hands-on, tactile materials to teach concepts. For example, to teach writing, students use sandpaper letters. These are letters created by cutting letters out of sandpaper and placing them on wooden blocks. The children then trace these letters with their fingers to learn the shape and sound of each letter. Another example is the use of bead chains to teach math concepts, specifically multiplication. Specifically for multiples of 10, there is one bead that represents one unit, a bar of ten beads put together that represents 1\u00d710, then a flat shape created by fitting 10 of the bars together to represent 10\u00d710, and a cube created by fitting 10 of the flats together to represent 10\u00d710\u00d710. These materials help build a concrete understanding of basic concepts upon which much is built in the later years.", "response": "The Montessori Method for Education in pre-school and kindergarten is a unique approach to teaching children to build self-confidence and independence.

{"instr": "Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what popular neural network architecture architecture are they based on?", "ctxt": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training.[11][12] These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "response": "The Transformer architecture.", "catgr": "cloqa"}

{"instr": "Provide a brief summary of how the ISO 27001 standard works", "ctxt": "Most organizations have a number of information security controls. However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.\n\nISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:\n\nSystematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nDesign and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and\nAdopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis.\nWhat controls will be tested as part of certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is dependent on the certification auditor. This can include any controls that the organisation has deemed to be within the scope of the ISMS and this testing can be to any depth or extent as assessed by the auditor as needed to test that the control has been implemented and is operating effectively.\n\nManagement determines the scope of the ISMS for certification purposes and may limit it to, say, a single business unit or location. The ISO/IEC 27001 certificate does not necessarily mean the remainder of the organization, outside the scoped area, has an adequate approach to information security management.\n\nOther standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide additional guidance on certain aspects of designing, implementing and operating an ISMS, for example on information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005).", "response": "The ISO 27001 standard works by requiring management of the information security management system to examine security risks, implement a comprehensive suite of security controls to manage the identified risks, and operate ongoing processes to measure control effectiveness and risk levels.", "catgr": "smzt"}

Most famously, every game since Final Fantasy II, including subsequent remakes of the original Final Fantasy, features a character named Cid. Cid's appearance, personality, goals, and role in the game (non-playable ally, party member, villain) vary dramatically. However, two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are being a scientist or engineer, and being tied in some way to an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid has at least one of these two traits.\n\nBiggs and Wedge, inspired by two Star Wars characters of the same name, appear in numerous games as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later games in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos, Moogles, and Cactuars. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments as a means of long-distance travel for characters. Moogles are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different roles in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, and saving the game. Cactuars are anthropomorphic cacti with haniwa-like faces presented in a running or dashing pose. They usually appear as recurring enemy units, and also as summoned allies or friendly non-player characters in certain titles.

The island was inhabited, however, and they were attacked.  One crew member was killed and the rest barely escaped.  From then on they dared not stop at any island until reaching the Great Barrier Reef of Australia (then called New Holland by the Europeans).\n\nIn a remarkable achievement of seamanship, Bligh and his men sailed and rowed their open boat for 41 days over a distance of 3618 miles, in sometimes harsh weather conditions.  Food and drink had to be strictly rationed, and the men suffered greatly from hunger and thirst.  Except for the death of the crewman at the hands of the islanders, all the remaining crew reached Timor alive.  Sadly, some men died of disease contracted at the colony town of Batavia or on the final return voyage to Europe.  Of the original nineteen men set adrift by the Bounty mutineers, twelve returned alive to England.\n\nBligh continued his career in the British Navy.  He was assigned a new ship and once again sailed to Tahiti take breadfruit to British colonies in the Caribbean.  This time, the mission was completed successfully.  Bligh commanded additional ships, including fighting in several major naval battles.  In 1805, Bligh was appointed Governor of New South Wales.  He ended his British Naval career as a Vice Admiral.

{"instr": "Write a journal entry from the pandemic.", "ctxt": "", "response": "I can\u2019t remember the last time I kept a journal. I used to write constantly as a little girl: in colorful notebooks gifted to me at Christmas or on my birthday. I always abandoned them when they were half full. Maybe a quarter if I was \u201cbusy.\u201d The truth is, I abandoned them when I realized no one but me cared about what I had to say; when I had stopped caring; when I realized I wasn\u2019t particularly profound. That may happen this time around, too.\n\nThe difference now is that even if I don\u2019t say anything profound: the timing is profound. We\u2019re living through a global pandemic, hiding in our homes, hoping we aren\u2019t infected and unknowingly infecting others. Avoiding people on the sidewalk when we go for walks, immediately wanting to wash our hands when picking something up after the grocery store after waiting in line for an hour.\n\nYesterday, it was my turn to go grocery shopping. My partner had been making the majority of our runs. The last time I joined him was weeks ago, before you could expect a line around the block. We had woken up early on a Saturday, and it was lightly raining, so I convinced him we should go to the Mollie Stones up the street to beat everyone there. About 12 people were lined up when we arrived, and we huddled under a tiny floral umbrella that lives in the trunk of our car.\n\nI had charged this particular umbrella to my corporate card when on a work trip to London, and even though it\u2019s barely functional, I won\u2019t throw it out. Opening it to cover us while waiting outside Mollie Stones, I daydreamed of going back to London. Of traveling at all. Of being able to run into a grocery store for brunch ingredients, and nothing more. Mollie Stones was always our destination for brunch ingredients after a particularly aggressive night out. I missed nights out: crowded bars where you had to raise your voice just to be heard, and yet were still annoyed when your best friend would scream into your ear. \n\nI managed to get through that trip to Mollie Stones without crying. The last time my partner and I went to that Mollie Stones, it was the Sunday before Mayor Breed directed San Francisco to shelter in place. There weren\u2019t any social distancing requirements, and the store was overrun by frantic shoppers. People bumped into each other in the aisles. The paper goods had been ransacked. The oat milk was nowhere to be found. We chose Mollie Stones because it\u2019s the most expensive grocery store in San Francisco, and we didn\u2019t think everyone would be stocking up there. But this is San Francisco, so we were wrong. I saw an elderly woman moving slowly through the store and started to hyperventilate. My partner wasn\u2019t far, so I managed to find him and take a few deep breaths so I could avoid a panic attack.\n\nSo, you can understand why I wasn\u2019t looking forward to my first solo grocery run. I chose the Costco in SOMA because so few people live south of Market, and it was the middle of the work week: maybe you can sneak away from Zoom meetings for a quick trip to Whole Foods or Trader Joe\u2019s, but Costco is an adventure, a commitment. Well, hundreds were as committed as I was. Probably to securing 30 rolls of toilet paper.\n\nI pulled into the Costco parking garage at 10am as it was opening. No cars waiting to enter, which I took as a good sign. Note to self: there are no good signs in a pandemic. After I finally found a parking spot, I meandered around the lot only to find myself at the back of what felt like a makeshift never-ending airport security line, hastily created with caution tape and lazily monitored by a Costco employee in a face mask with megaphone. Every few minutes, he would remind us to stay six feet apart.\n\nDespite being hopeful about the wait, I came prepared. My face was completely covered by a N95 mask, which I admit, I felt guilty about. Healthcare workers all over America needed PPE, and here I was, waiting in line at Costco wearing one piece of the ensemble. I had purchased a 10-pack after the last fire season and had broken the seal on the pack, making them impossible to donate. My mask makes me feel like a child or a cartoon character: it spans from my chin to the bottom of my eyelids. To complement it, I\u2019m rocking ski gloves (plastic are almost impossible to come by), and have multiple episodes of The Daily downloaded on my phone. I take my spot at the back of the line, which has six or so switchbacks, and settle in to catch up with Michael Barbaro. \n\nI\u2019ve been listening to The Daily for over a year now: almost everyday, either on my commute or while working out in the morning. But since quarantining, I\u2019ve sadly kicked the habit. Without a gym or a ride to work, it doesn\u2019t easily fit into my schedule. I miss Michael\u2019s \u201cand here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\u201d\n\nThe first episode up features a conversation with Paul Mozur, a technology reporter based in Asia \u2014 originally Shanghai. He, along with a handful of other American reporters, were unceremoniously banned from China and forced to leave the country, and he shared both his emotional reaction and the reasons why. \n\nI then chose \u201cvoices of the pandemic,\u201d an episode cut into four parts: reporters talking to Americans impacted by the pandemic in Pittsburgh, Kansas City, New York and Seattle. Parents who are now homeschooling their screaming toddlers. A former waitress now living in her car trying to get a job at a grocery store, but unable to locate her birth certificate. A nurse who can no longer see her grandchildren because she\u2019s treating COVID patients. I teared up listening to her recall the first night in the hospital when they confirmed two cases of COVID-19. She felt a sense of purpose and camaraderie with her coworkers, but realized almost immediately that it meant she wouldn\u2019t be able to host her weekly sleepover with her grandchildren. She described in detail the room she decorated for them in her house, and how their beds will remain empty for weeks.\n\nThree Daily episodes in, and I\u2019m finally making progress in the Costco line, winding up the ramp, where red tape at our feet clearly marks the required 6-foot gap between you and the people in front and behind you. Once inside the massive warehouse, I chart a course to the paper goods and make it my mission to secure toilet paper and paper towels. A success on that front makes the wait feel worthwhile, and I start to check items off my list with purpose. Although Costco employees are strategically placed throughout the warehouse, every so often lifting a megaphone to remind shoppers to stay six feet apart, there are a few ways that make this Costco trip rather typical: I pack my shopping cart to the brim, spend far too much money, and rush out the door. More than anything, I can\u2019t wait to take my mask off.", "catgr": ""cwt"}
