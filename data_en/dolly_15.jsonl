It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution and the nation's founding, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the siege of Boston. Upon American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture. The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation. Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year. Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston Common, 1634), first public or state school (Boston Latin School, 1635) first subway system (Tremont Street subway, 1897), and first large public library (Boston Public Library, 1848).\n\nToday, Boston is a center of scientific research; the area's many colleges and universities, notably Harvard and MIT, make it a world leader in higher education, including law, medicine, engineering and business, and the city is considered to be a global pioneer in innovation and entrepreneurship, with nearly 5,000 startups.

He was left melancholic, pessimistic and fixed on death.[17] His next book, marked by \"a skeptical and realistic tone\": Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas (Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas, also translated as Epitaph of a Small Winner), is widely considered a masterpiece.[18] By the end of the 1880s, Machado had gained wide renown as a writer.[8]\n\nAlthough he was opposed to slavery, he never spoke against it in public.[16][19] He avoided discussing politics.[18][19] He was criticized by the abolitionist Jos\u00e9 do Patroc\u00ednio and by the writer Lima Barreto for staying away from politics, especially the cause of abolition.[1][19] He was also criticized by them for having married a white woman.[1] Machado was caught by surprise with the monarchy overthrown on 15 November 1889.[18] Machado had no sympathy towards republicanism,[18] as he considered himself a liberal monarchist[20] and venerated Pedro II, whom he perceived as \"a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect.\"[21] When a commission went to the public office where he worked to remove the picture of the former emperor, the shy Machado defied them: \"The picture got in here by an order and it shall leave only by another order.\"[18]\n\nThe birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time.[22] From then on, he wrote \"not only the greatest novels of his time, but the greatest of all time of Brazilian literature.\"[20] Works such as Quincas Borba (Philosopher or Dog?)

They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15 ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10\u201315 cm (4\u20136 in) long and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at the base to form interpetiolar stipules, characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of an inferior ovary, also characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5 cm (0.6 in).[43] When immature, they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5\u201310% of the berries[44] have only one; these are called peaberries.[45] Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta takes nine to eleven months.[46]\n\nCoffea arabica is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result, the seedlings are generally uniform and vary little from their parents. In contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and require outcrossing. This means that useful forms and hybrids must be propagated vegetatively.[47] Cuttings, grafting, and budding are the usual methods of vegetative propagation.[48] On the other hand, there is great scope for experimentation in search of potential new strains.[47]", "response": "Coffea canephora; C. arabica; C. liberica; C. stenophylla; C. mauritiana; C. racemosa", "catgr":"infet"}

Some say that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis it could have had profound effects on the trajectory of human history.  Historian's trace back much of today's Western ideals in philosophy, culture, politics, and science to Ancient Greece.  They deduce that if Persia had won the Greco-Persian wars it could have oppressed the blossoming of many modern Western schools of thought.  \n\nSalamis is one of many skirmishes fought over the course of almost half a century during this conflict.  There were other pivotal battles that contributed to the Greek victory, like Marathon and Plataea.  However, if Salamis had been won by the Persians, the Greek navy would have been unable to stop them from establishing beachheads across Greece.  Much of the Greek victory has been attributed to their use of the environment to their advantage; leveraging natural chokepoints (like at Salamis) to reduce the effectiveness of Persia's numerical advantage.  Had Salamis fallen to the Persians it's reasonable to assume that this strategy would have failed and Persia's massive armies would have been able to dominate the Greeks.  \n\nIt's also impossible to predict the outcome of the war if Persia had won this battle, even though chances are things would have ended very differently.  Salamis is perhaps more highly regarded because of the long odds the Greek navy faced.  They were able to prevail despite being largely outnumbered, which could also be why it's considered such a remarkable event.", "catgr": "cloqa"}

After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, she rose to solo stardom with her debut studio album, Madonna (1983). She followed it with a series of successful albums, including all-time bestsellers Like a Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986) and The Immaculate Collection (1990), as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Madonna has amassed many chart-topping singles throughout her career, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"La Isla Bonita\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Take a Bow\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\".\n\nMadonna's popularity was enhanced by roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996). While Evita won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her other films were not as well received. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded the company Maverick in 1992. It included Maverick Records, one of the most successful artist-run labels in history. Her other ventures include fashion brands, written works, health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded the Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006.\n\nWith sales of over 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is the best-selling female recording artist of all time. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and has achieved the most number-one singles by a woman in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. With a revenue of over US$1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing female touring artist worldwide. Forbes has named Madonna the annual top-earning female musician a record 11 times across four decades (1980s\u20132010s). She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of eligibility. Madonna was ranked as the greatest woman in music by VH1, and as the greatest music video artist ever by MTV and Billboard. Rolling Stone also listed her among its greatest artists and greatest songwriters of all time.", "catgr":"infet"}

Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur.[74] Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active.[74] In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation.[74] In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells.[74]", "response": "Operons are clusters of genes that share the same promoter.

The team which scores the most goals is declared the winner. In a formal game, each team has six skaters on the ice at a time, barring any penalties, one of whom is the goaltender. Ice hockey is a full contact sport, and is considered to be one of the more physically demanding sports.[1]\n\nIce hockey is one of the sports featured in the Winter Olympics while its premiere international competition, the IIHF World Championships, are governed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for both men's and women's competitions.\n\nIn North America and parts of Europe the sport is known simply as hockey[citation needed]. However, in other countries, \"hockey\" usually refers to field hockey. In 1994 hockey was officially recognized as Canada's national winter sport.[2]\n\nThe modern sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor game was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and professional ice hockey originated around 1900. The Stanley Cup, emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was initially commissioned in 1892 as the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\" and was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the National Hockey League (NHL). In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, in Paris, France, the precursor of the IIHF. The sport was played for the first time at the Olympics during the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile women also played during the game's early formative years, it was not until organizers began to officially remove body checking from female ice hockey beginning in the mid-1980s that it began to gain greater popularity, which by then had spread to Europe and a variety of other countries.

Despite the low speed of travel (\u224810\u201340 km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed and often scored ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snowpacks that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93).[7] At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles at the end of the winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.", "response": "Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snowpacks that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water.", "catgr": "smzt"}

{"instr": "How do UK telephone numbers work?", "ctxt": "", "response": "The UK telephone numbering system has a strange and complicated pattern which is born out of many historical changes and anomalies. Essentially nearly all numbers start with 0 when dialled in the UK. The leading 0 is omitted when calling from overseas and the prefix \"+44\" is added in its place. The second digit indicates what type of number it is. So called geographic numbers (those associated with an area code) start with 01or 02. Numbers starting with 03 are not associated with any area code but are charged at the same rates as numbers beginning with 01 or 02. Mobile numbers always start with 07. Numbers starting 09 are premium rate numbers which incur high charges for providing additional services.  Numbers starting with 080 are toll free. Other numbers starting with 08 are charged at special rates but not the very high rates for 09 numbers.\n\nSpecial numbers that do not start with 0 include 999 and 112 for emergencies, 101 for non emergency Police matters, 111 for contacting the National Health Service in a non emergency and directory enquiries services that start with 118.\n\nThe history of UK area codes (beginning 01 and 02) dates back to the times when individual telephone exchanges had their own one, two or three character Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) codes (e.g. B for Birmingham or AY6 for Aylesbury). in 1966 STD codes were converted to numbers using the number patterns on telephone dials (where 2=ABC, 3 = DEF etc.) so Birmingham became 021, Aylesbury became 0296. 01 was the code allocated to London. Area codes were between 2 and five characters long including the leading zero. Following the area code a local number of between 3 and 7 digits was added for each line to make the complete number either 9 or 10 digits long. Callers within the same area code could dial other lines with the same code by simply dialling the local number omitting the area code. In 1968 area codes beginning 00 were moved to free up 00 for other uses.\n\nBy the 1980s a number of factors meant that some areas, especially London, were running out of codes. Various measures were introduced including, in 1990,  the splitting of London into 071 (inner London) and 081 (outer London).\n\nThe 80s and 90s also saw the gradual introduction of \"non geographic\" numbers e.g. the toll free 0800 numbers and a number of patterns for emerging mobile services. Premium rate services were also launched using 0898.\n\nIn 1995 on so called \"phONEday\" a leading 1 was added after the zero. London numbers became either 0171 or 0181, Birmingham 0121, Aylesbury 01296 etc.\n\nThis established the pattern we see today allowing for some area codes to move to \"02\" codes over the next few years. In addition larger cities were allocated new codes beginning 011 e.g. 0113 for Leeds, 0117 for Bristol.\n\nIn 2000 the \"big number change\" saw London codes changed yet again = 0171 became 020 7 and 0181 became 020 8 allowing for new London numbers to be issued starting with 020 3 and 020 4 . Other cities that gained \"02\" style codes were Southampton/Portsmouth 023 , Coventry 024 and Cardiff 029.  A unified code of 028 was introduced in Northern Ireland.", "catgr": "gqa"}

While many learn to ski when they're young, there are lots of people that only started to ski at an older age. With the right motivation and a willingness to put time and effort, almost anyone can learn to ski. Also, advances to ski equipment and slope grooming technology make skiing a lot safer than it used to be years ago.\n\nLearning to ski as an adult may take longer than learning as a child. It is recommended that you start with some lessons first to gain the right technique. This could be group lessons or private lessons. You could also learn from friends who know how to ski, or learn by watching online tutorials and applying them yourself on the mountain. Once you have the basic skills, you should be able to ski easy slopes and start enjoying skiing as a fun activity. \n\nIn addition to lessons, you will also need the right gear to ski. This includes appropriate clothing that can keep you warm on the mountain while you ski, as well as ski equipment that you will use. It is recommended that you get a pair of skis and poles, good fitting boots, a helmet for safety, and goggles to protect your eyes from the elements. Renting your equipment is a good option when you're starting. That way you are not making an expensive commitment upfront. You could also buy your equipment either new or from any of the second-hand ski shops and ski swaps.\n \nWith the right gear and knowledge of the basics, you can take your learning in any direction you want. Many people choose to stay at a beginner or intermediate level and just enjoy the occasional ski trip with friends. While others take their passion forward with more practice, hours on the mountain, and likely more lessons to get to advanced levels.\n\nWhichever path you pick, skiing can be a fun sport to learn and enjoy for the rest of your life.

{"instr": "Given a reference text, who is the Ryder Cup named after?", "ctxt": "The Ryder Cup is a biennial men's golf competition between teams from Europe and the United States. The competition is contested every two years with the venue alternating between courses in the United States and Europe. The Ryder Cup is named after the English businessman Samuel Ryder who donated the trophy. The event is jointly administered by the PGA of America and Ryder Cup Europe, the latter a joint venture of the PGA European Tour (60%), the PGA of Great Britain and Ireland (20%), and the PGAs of Europe (20%).[1][2]\n\nOriginally contested between Great Britain and the United States, the first official Ryder Cup took place in the United States in 1927 at Worcester Country Club in Worcester, Massachusetts. The home team won the first five contests, but with the competition's resumption after the Second World War, repeated American dominance eventually led to a decision to extend the representation of \"Great Britain and Ireland\" to include continental Europe from 1979. The inclusion of continental European golfers was partly prompted by the success of a new generation of Spanish golfers, led by Seve Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido. In 1973 the official title of the British Team had been changed from \"Great Britain\" to \"Great Britain and Ireland\", but this was simply a change of name to reflect the fact that golfers from the Republic of Ireland had been playing in the Great Britain Ryder Cup team since 1953, while Northern Irish players had competed since 1947. In addition to players from Great Britain and Ireland, the European team has since included players from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden.", "response": "The Ryder Cup is named after English businessman Samuel Ryder.", "catgr": "cloqa"}

{"instr": "What makes airplanes fly?", "ctxt": "", "response": "When an airplane engine starts, the propeller creates thrust and pulls the airplane forward.  As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.  As thrust increases and pulls the plane forward, the lift eventually increases enough to overcome the weight and drag and the airplane will take flight.", "catgr": "gqa"}

When a country is experiencing deflation, the central bank will typically decrease interest rates to reduce cost of credit and increase consumption. Central banks must be careful with interest rates.

Some techniques prefer breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth, although this is not required. One way to narrow your attention is to closely observe the sensation of cool air as it passes over the tip of your nose, and the sensation of your chest falling as you exhale. Allow any rising thoughts to pass through your mind without paying attention to them, or engaging with them.\n\nOther techniques involve focusing your attention to sensations in your body like hot and cold, or pain. You can also bring your focus to feelings like fear, anxiety, or love - focus your attention on where exactly in the body you feel those feelings. You can also move your attention to external stimulus like sounds, and your visual field.\n\nMindfulness is an extremely powerful technique that anyone can do from anywhere.

When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle.

{"instr": "Given this paragraph about kubernetes, what is the storage layer of Kubernetes control plane?", "ctxt": "The Kubernetes master node handles the Kubernetes control plane of the cluster, managing its workload and directing communication across the system. The Kubernetes control plane consists of various components, each its own process, that can run both on a single master node or on multiple masters supporting high-availability clusters.[36] The various components of the Kubernetes control plane are as follows:\n\netcd[37] is a persistent, lightweight, distributed, key-value data store that CoreOS has developed. It reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the overall state of the cluster at any given point of time. etcd favors consistency over availability in the event of a network partition (see CAP theorem). The consistency is crucial for correctly scheduling and operating services.\nThe API server serves the Kubernetes API using JSON over HTTP, which provides both the internal and external interface to Kubernetes.[35][38] The API server processes and validates REST requests and updates the state of the API objects in etcd, thereby allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across worker nodes.[39] The API server uses etcd's watch API to monitor the cluster, roll out critical configuration changes, or restore any divergences of the state of the cluster back to what the deployer declared. As an example, the deployer may specify that three instances of a particular \"pod\" (see below) need to be running. etcd stores this fact. If the Deployment Controller finds that only two instances are running (conflicting with the etcd declaration),[40] it schedules the creation of an additional instance of that pod.[36]\nThe scheduler is the extensible component that selects on which node an unscheduled pod (the basic entity managed by the scheduler) runs, based on resource availability. The scheduler tracks resource use on each node to ensure that workload is not scheduled in excess of available resources. For this purpose, the scheduler must know the resource requirements, resource availability, and other user-provided constraints or policy directives such as quality-of-service, affinity vs. anti-affinity requirements, and data locality. The scheduler's role is to match resource \"supply\" to workload \"demand\".[41]\nA controller is a reconciliation loop that drives the actual cluster state toward the desired state, communicating with the API server to create, update, and delete the resources it manages (e.g., pods or service endpoints).[42][38] One kind of controller is a Replication Controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails.[42] Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a DaemonSet Controller for running exactly one pod on every machine (or some subset of machines), and a Job Controller for running pods that run to completion (e.g., as part of a batch job).[43] Labels selectors that are part of the controller's definition specify the set of pods that a controller manages.[44]\nThe controller manager is a process that manages a set of core Kubernetes controllers.", "response": "ETCD", "catgr": "cloqa"}

The result should be an authentic representation of the company. \n\nTimeline: A rebrand project would include 6-8 weeks of discovery (conducting a formal audit of the company's current brand and interviews with team members, customers and partners), leading to multiple weeks of reviews, eventually resulting in a brand identity and brand book to share the updated brand with your employee base. \n\nResources and budget: Estimated $300,000 - 500,000 (cost varies widely and depends on the size of the firm and scope of project). In order for this project to be successful, secure upfront executive buy-in and alignment, and time from the executive team starting at the discovery phase through reviews and the final debut.\n\nMeasurement: Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to assign a quantitative metric to measure the success of a rebrand and messaging project, so put qualitative measurements in place for the short-term, assessing how well you captured how your customers think of your company, and how well you captured the vision for the future.

Named after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the ship was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.\n\nIn the course of the warship's eight-month career, Bismarck conducted only one offensive operation that lasted 8 days in May 1941, codenamed Rhein\u00fcbung. The ship, along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the battlecruiser HMS Hood initially engaged Prinz Eugen, probably by mistake, while HMS Prince of Wales engaged Bismarck. In the ensuing battle Hood was destroyed by the combined fire of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen, which then damaged Prince of Wales and forced her retreat. Bismarck suffered sufficient damage from three hits by Prince of Wales to force an end to the raiding mission.\n\nThe destruction of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for occupied France to effect repairs, Bismarck was attacked by fifteen Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning, the already-crippled Bismarck was engaged by two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, and sustained incapacitating damage and heavy loss of life. The ship was scuttled to prevent her being boarded by the British, and to allow the ship to be abandoned so as to limit further casualties. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually.\n\nThe wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard, and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.", "response": "The Bismarck was a battleship built for the German Navy in World War 2.

{"instr": "How the interpretation of the word nature evolved over time?", "ctxt": "Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. \"Nature\" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.[1]\n\nThe word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or \"essential qualities, innate disposition\", and in ancient times, literally meant \"birth\".[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.\n\nDuring the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.[1]\n\nWithin the various uses of the word today, \"nature\" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects\u2014the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the \"natural environment\" or wilderness\u2014wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, \"human nature\" or \"the whole of nature\". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term \"natural\" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.[1]", "response": "In ancient times nature was derived from the Greek word physis (translated into Latin as natura), that is related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals.

{"instr": "How did early civilizations use dates and dried fruits?", "ctxt": "Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "Early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners.

{"instr": "Given these paragraphs about Multiomics, what is panomics?", "ctxt": "Multiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics", "response": "The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"", "catgr": "cloqa"}

The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another.

In those same years, the Japanese government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer project. Another encouraging event in the early 1980s was the revival of connectionism in the work of John Hopfield and David Rumelhart. Once again, AI had achieved success.[138]\n\nThe rise of expert systems\nAn expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.[139]\n\nExpert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point.[140]\n\nIn 1980, an expert system called XCON was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation. It was an enormous success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986.[141] Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments.[142] An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.[143]", "response": "An expert system is a program that uses logical rules derived from expert knowledge to answer questions or solve problems in a specific domain of knowledge.

Traditionally, those who run \"runners\" will run 5-7 days a week. Runners will average between 3 miles per run up to 20 miles per run. While running is great exercise and very efficient at burning calories, it can be hard on the body. Specifically the leg joints. The average runner will strike the surface they are running on 1,480 times per mile. So if you are running 10 miles, thats just under 15,000 foot strikes. This repetitive striking can deteriorate the body joints over time. Therefore, the type of surface a runner runs on, can have a huge impact on the body. Some surfaces are harder than others, the harder the surface, the harder on the body, legs and joints. Concrete is harder than asphalt, asphalt is harder than a dirt trail and a dirt trail is harder than a high school track surface. Example, concrete can be 30% harder surface than asphalt. Running is a great exercise and millions of people enjoy running. But if you want to run long, as in for a long time, choose your running surface for the long run.

Within six months of the transfer, Belgium was required to conduct a plebiscite on whether the citizens of the region wanted to remain under Belgian sovereignty or return to German control, communicate the results to the League of Nations and abide by the League's decision.[n. 8] To compensate for the destruction of French coal mines, Germany was to cede the output of the Saar coalmines to France and control of the Saar to the League of Nations for 15 years; a plebiscite would then be held to decide sovereignty.[n. 9] The treaty restored the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to France by rescinding the treaties of Versailles and Frankfurt of 1871 as they pertained to this issue.[n. 10] France was able to make the claim that the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine were indeed part of France and not part of Germany by disclosing a letter sent from the Prussian King to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie that Eug\u00e9nie provided, in which William I wrote that the territories of Alsace-Lorraine were requested by Germany for the sole purpose of national defense and not to expand the German territory.[65] The sovereignty of Schleswig-Holstein was to be resolved by a plebiscite to be held at a future time (see Schleswig Plebiscites).[66]\n\nIn Central Europe Germany was to recognize the independence of Czechoslovakia (which had actually been controlled by Austria) and cede parts of the province of Upper Silesia.[n. 11] Germany had to recognize the independence of Poland and renounce \"all rights and title over the territory\".

Other states in the United States have similar provisions regarding classified boards.\n\nFor boards that have only 1 class, each director serves a fixed term (generally 1 year), and each director is subject to re-election each year.  \n\nClassified boards (also known as staggered boards) are divided into three separate classes (in equal proportion, to the extent possible), with members of each class serving three-year terms and only one class of directors up for election in any year.  \n\nA classified board is one type of protection that companies consider as part of a wider range review of corporate defensive measures.  Generally, corporate defensive measures relate to measures for a company to consider to protect against (1) hostile takeovers that the board believes do not reflect the value of the company and (2) short-termism, where there is pressure from public investors \u2013 particularly activist investors \u2013 to take board actions (or face the risk of being voted off the board) that the board believes are not in the best interest of the company and its stockholders and maximizing value over the long term.  Corporate defensive measures generally aren\u2019t relevant when a company is private given the corporate structure with significant long-term investor representation on the board and various agreements in place with stockholders.  However, these measures become relevant once a company has public stockholders, so many companies who are considering an initial public offering will assess what types of defensive measures would be appropriate for them.\n\nA classified board is viewed as corporate defensive measure (i.e., it\u2019s an anti-takeover and activist defense) as the entire board can\u2019t be replaced in a single election cycle (with 3 classes, it would take up to the 3rd election cycle for the full board to be replaced, and generally 2 years to capture a majority).", "catgr": "gqa"}

Why would anyone ever require 20 shovels? A shovel by itself might be helpful, but 20 is way too many, and certainly not useful. Also, if one is at the beach, then boots are likely overkill and not useful, since most beach-goers tend to be barefoot or wear sandals. Lastly, the list contains two items which are impractical for any beach trip: a parachute and a grand piano. In my entire life, I've never seen a grand piano at the beach. They're beautiful instruments, but very heavy and would take a ton of effort to get on the beach, not to mention the possible damage to the piano. A parachute is also similarly impractical.

Only in the realm of vocal composition \u2013 opera and the mass \u2013 was his effect on later generations muted.\n\nBeethoven's stylistic innovations bridge the Classical and Romantic periods. The works of his early period brought the Classical form to its highest expressive level, expanding in formal, structural, and harmonic terms the musical idiom developed by predecessors such as Mozart and Haydn. The works of his middle period were more forward-looking, contributing to the musical language and thinking of the Romantic era, inspiring composers such as Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, and Johannes Brahms. His late period works were characterized by formal, harmonic, and structural experimentation at the highest level, often pointing toward contrapuntal tendencies and microscopic textures, as well as an increasingly introverted compositional outlook. Though rightly credited as a major harbinger of the Romantic era in music that followed, Beethoven never abandoned the fundamental formal paradigms and generally objective artistic philosophy characterizing musical Classicism to the same extent that later composers such as Berlioz or even Schubert did.", "response": "- Heightened the symphonic form and had a dramatic influence on the piano sonata, violin sonata, string quartet, piano concertos and other genres\n- Contributed to the musical language and thinking of the romantic era\n- Formal, harmonic and structural experimentation in his later works", "catgr": "smzt"}

{"instr": "How do I wire an electrical outlet?", "ctxt": "", "response": "While wiring an outlet can be a fairly simple task when following all safety precautions, if you are unsure about anything or have a complicated scenario, it is best to consult a licensed electrician that understands local electrical code and laws. \n\nTools and Materials Needed:\n\nOutlet, of appropriate amperage \nElectrical box - (Old-work type for adding an outlet to your home) \nNon-metallic (NM) cable (also known as Romex) of appropriate gauge and length\nWire connectors (twist type or lever-nut type) \nNon-Contact Voltage Detector\nWire stripper\nScrewdriver\n\nSteps If you are installing new outlet: \n\n1. Turn off the power to the circuit you'll be working on by turning off the breaker \n2. Locate a nearby junction box, and confirm there is no power running to it with the non-contact voltage detector. \n3. Once deemed safe,  remove the cover plate.\n4. Run a new length of Romex cable from the junction box to the location of the new outlet. You may need to drill holes through studs, floors, or even cut holes in the wall to achieve this. \n5. If the old outlet has connection screws that are not used, you may attach the new wire to the old outlet to run power to the new outlet. These are usually labeled \u201cload\u201d on the outlet.  Otherwise, you will need to detach existing wiring and combine wiring colors together (black to black, white, to white, etc) and use pigtails to wire run a single wire to the outlet. \n6. Follow the same steps as you would connecting wire to the new outlet found below to attach wiring to the existing outlet. \n7. At the new location, cut a hole in the wall where you want the outlet to be.\n8. Attach an electrical box (old-work type) to the wall using screws to tension the boxes tabs and secure it in place.\n\nSteps to follow for both new outlet installation and replacing existing outlets:  \n\n1. Strip the outer insulation from the cable and separate the wires.\n2. Strip about \u00bd inch of insulation from each wire (black, white, and green or bare). Depending on your house and wiring, you may have a 4th gray wire or even a red wire in place of black. The gray wire is the neutral wire that is often needed for smart devices to correctly function. If your device specifies the need for this wire, and you do not have one, please consult an electrician.  A red wire indicates the outlet is switched, and is also \u201chot\u201d like a black wire. One will commonly find these routed to lights or fans. \n3. Connect the black wire to the brass-colored screw on the outlet (designated as \u201cline\u201d) and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"hot\" wire and carries the electrical current.\n4. Connect the white wire to the silver-colored screw (designated as \u201cline\u201d) on the outlet and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"neutral\" wire and completes the circuit.\n5. Connect the green or bare wire to the green screw on the outlet and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"ground\" wire and provides a path for electricity to safely flow to the ground in case of a short circuit.\n6. Gently push the outlet into the box, making sure not to pinch any wires.\n7. Screw the outlet into the box.\n8. Install the cover plate.\n9. Turn the power back on and test the outlet to make sure it's working.", "catgr": ""cwt"}

The list includes established breeds recognized by various cat registries, new and experimental breeds, landraces being established as standardized breeds, distinct domestic populations not being actively developed and lapsed (extinct) breeds.\n\nAs of 2023, The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes 73 standardized breeds,[1] the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 45,[2] the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale F\u00e9line (FIFe) recognizes 50,[3] the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognizes 45,[4] and the World Cat Federation (WCF) recognizes 69.[5]\n\nInconsistency in a breed classification and naming among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries (though not necessarily eligible for registry in them all, depending on its exact ancestry). For example, TICA's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint variety of the Persian by the CFA, while the Javanese (or Colorpoint Longhair) is a color variation of the Balinese in both the TICA and the CFA; both breeds are merged (along with the Colorpoint Shorthair) into a single \"mega-breed\", the Colourpoint, by the World Cat Federation (WCF), who have repurposed the name \"Javanese\" for the Oriental Longhair. Also, \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to different breeds in other registries. There are many examples of nomenclatural overlap and differences of this sort. Furthermore, many geographical and cultural names for cat breeds are fanciful selections made by Western breeders to be exotic sounding and bear no relationship to the actual origin of the breeds;[6] the Balinese, Javanese, and Himalayan are all examples of this trend.\n\nThe domestic short-haired and domestic long-haired cat types are not breeds, but terms used (with various spellings) in the cat fancy to describe \"mongrel\" or \"bicolor\" cats by coat length, ones that do not belong to a particular breed. Some registries permit them to be pedigreed and they have been used as foundation stock in the establishment of some breeds.[citation needed] They should not be confused with standardized breeds with similar names, such as the British Shorthair and Oriental Longhair.", "response": "Base on the examples taken from the text, give me the total # of The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes standardized breeds", "catgr": "smzt"}

He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a U.S. senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States and the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation.\n\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in 1996, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nClinton's second term was dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which began in 1996, when he had a sexual relationship with 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, an intern at the White House. In January 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines.[1] This scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president\u2014the first since Andrew Johnson\u2014to be impeached. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around him using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and lying under oath. In 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate. He was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, which was necessary to meet the two-thirds conviction threshold prescribed by Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nClinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton and George W. Bush formed the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.
