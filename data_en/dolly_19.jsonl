{"instr": "Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what corpus was the first model in OpenAI's GPT series trained in 2018 on?", "ctxt": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "response": "BookCorpus.", "catgr": "cloqa"}

{"instr": "What are the signs and symptoms of Sensory processing disorder?", "ctxt": "Sensory integration difficulties or sensory processing disorder (SPD) are characterized by persistent challenges with neurological processing of sensory stimuli that interfere with a person's ability to participate in everyday life. Such challenges can appear in one or several sensory systems of the somatosensory system, vestibular system, proprioceptive system, interoceptive system, auditory system, visual system, olfactory system, and gustatory system.\nWhile many people can present one or two symptoms, sensory processing disorder has to have a clear functional impact on the person's life:\nSigns of over-responsivity, including, for example, dislike of textures such as those found in fabrics, foods, grooming products or other materials found in daily living, to which most people would not react, and serious discomfort, sickness or threat induced by normal sounds, lights, ambient temperature, movements, smells, tastes, or even inner sensations such as heartbeat.Signs of under-responsivity, including sluggishness and lack of responsiveness.\nSensory cravings, including, for example, fidgeting, impulsiveness, and/or seeking or making loud, disturbing noises; and sensorimotor-based problems, including slow and uncoordinated movements or poor handwriting.\nSensory discrimination problems, which might manifest themselves in behaviors such as things constantly dropped.\nSymptoms may vary according to the disorder's type and subtype present.\nSensory integration and processing difficulties can be a feature of a number of disorders, including anxiety problems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),food intolerances, behavioural disorders, and particularly, autism spectrum disorders. This pattern of comorbidities poses a significant challenge to those who claim that SPD is an identifiably specific disorder, rather than simply a term given to a set of symptoms common to other disorders.\nTwo studies have provided preliminary evidence suggesting that there may be measurable neurological differences between children diagnosed with SPD and control children classified as neurotypical or children diagnosed with autism. Despite this evidence, that SPD researchers have yet to agree on a proven, standardized diagnostic tool undermines researchers' ability to define the boundaries of the disorder and makes correlational studies, like those on structural brain abnormalities, less convincing.", "response": "While many people with Sensory processing disorder can present one or two symptoms, it has to have a clear functional impact on the person's life:\nSigns of over-responsivity, including, for example, dislike of textures such as those found in fabrics, foods, grooming products or other materials found in daily living, to which most people would not react, and serious discomfort, sickness or threat induced by normal sounds, lights, ambient temperature, movements, smells, tastes, or even inner sensations such as heartbeat.Signs of under-responsivity, including sluggishness and lack of responsiveness.\nSensory cravings, including, for example, fidgeting, impulsiveness, and/or seeking or making loud, disturbing noises; and sensorimotor-based problems, including slow and uncoordinated movements or poor handwriting.", "catgr": "cloqa"}

{"instr": "What is the best modern motorcycle for a beginning rider?", "ctxt": "", "response": "If you have no or little experience with motorcycles, choosing a good first motorcycle can be challenging. While it is tempting to buy your dream supersport or touring cruiser, your first bike should be one that you can feel confident on so you can quickly master the skills necessary to ride a faster or larger bike more safely. Assess a new bike not from a place of desire, but from practical perspective, and consider these qualities:\n\n- Seat height: For most new riders, confidence comes more quickly when you can place both feet on the ground with a little bend in the knees. If you have a 32\" inseam, consider bikes with a 31\" or less seat height. If you have a 28\" inseam, consider bikes with a 27\" or lower seat height. Note that some bikes have wider \"waists\" that require you to spread your legs farther apart, so visit a dealer and sit on a variety of bikes until you find ones that you can sit comfortable atop with both feet planted.\n\n- Center of gravity: Bikes weigh from 250 lbs (dirt bikes) to over 800 lbs (large \"dresser\" cruiser bikes). Most bikes weigh between 400 and 600 lbs. However, weight isn't what makes a bike tip over easily -- rather, it's where the center of gravity is located. Sport bikes and adventure bikes carry their weight higher and more forward in the frame, where as standard and cruiser bikes carry it lower and closer to the rider. If you, as a new rider, grab a fistful of front brake during a low speed maneuver, what is going to cause the bike to start tipping over faster? Having a heavy weight high and forward. When assessing a first bike, look at where the engine and transmission mass seems to be centered relative to rider position. Sit on the bike with both feet planted and tilt it a little to the left and the right. Do you feel more or less strain on your shoulders as you bring it back it back to center? If you feel more, that sensation will become a danger when your learning low speed maneuvers and require more physical compensation, and will inhibit your ability to develop a good low speed riding technique.\n\n- Ergonomics: Most people feel cool in a racer's lean on a supersport, or slung back in a feet-forward posture when riding a cruiser. However, starting in those positions as a new rider can lead to discomfort, or inhibit your ability to develop solid basic riding techniques. Ideally, you want to be upright, elbows loose and bent and even with the bars. Your back should be straight with about a 5 degree forward lean. Your feet should be below your hips with a comfortable bend to the knees. In this position, you have the flexibility to better compensate for a lack of experience and technique when you encounter challenging situations on the road.\n\n- Engine displacement: Much ado is made about choosing the right displacement for a start bike. This is a bit of a myth: very few bikes, regardless of displacement, are fundamentally hostile to a new rider when it comes to engine performance: they are as fast or as slow as you treat the throttle. That said, smaller displacement bikes tend to be lighter, have lower seats, and are generally more newbie-friendly. However, some larger displacement bikes, including 650-900cc standards and 1100cc-plus cruisers can also be safe to learn on, as they favor low-revving torque over high-revving horsepower, with relatively gentle throttle response but plenty of grunt to push you forward from idle without extensive clutch feathering and rev management. Conversely, some smaller bikes, like the Kawasaki Ninja 250, require extensive revving and frequent gear shifting to get to street and highway speeds. Ask yourself: Do I want a light bike that will force me to learn good gear and rev management (a good idea if you have track aspirations), or a heavier bike that starts moving right off idle and requires less gear changing at street speeds? That's your answer to the question of displacement.\n\n- Throttle and brake response. Modern fuel injection, ECU development, and environmental emissions regulations have led to a situation where many sportier bikes have notchy throttles at low speeds, where closing the throttle cuts fuel and causes the bike to lurch a bit. This can be unpleasant for new riders who have yet to learn partial clutch management skills. Additionally, powerful sport bikes with inline-4 or V4 engine configuration can stutter and lurch at very low revs, requiring careful clutch and rev management that might be unfamiliar or uncomfortable to new riders -- these are bikes designed to be ridden fast, high in their powerbands. Additionally, powerful supersports and \"hooligan\" supermotos have very powerful brakes, like Brembo's Stylema or M4 units, which can easily pitch a new rider over the bars if they haven't developed a light, progressive touch on the brakes. If you, as a new rider, are having to spend your riding time compensating for unpredictable throttle behaviors or aggressive brakes, you aren't in a place to quickly learn good techniques safely.\n\nSo with all that in mind, what are some good starter bikes?\n\n- Kawasaki Ninja 400 or Z400: If your ambition is to ride a powerful supersport (like Kawasaki's own ZX-10R), start with a Ninja 400 or Z400. The Ninja is similar in style to supersport bikes, but has raised \"clip-on\" handle bars that convey the appearance of a racer but raise the incline of your posture to a more comfortable space. They also have a slightly lower seat height, and an accommodating 399cc parallel-twin motor with good throttle response and solid but unthreatening brakes. The Z400 is a more upright version of the Ninja 400 that shares the same engine and brakes, but lacks the plastic fairing and clip-on grips. Similar bikes include Yamaha's 321cc R3 and MT-03, Honda's CBR500F and CBR500R, KTM's RC390 and Duke 390, and BMW's G310. All of them perform very similarly, and are considered great gateway bikes to sport riding. Many track enthusiasts favor these bikes due to their light weight, engaging engines, and overall low cost of maintenance and insurance. If you really feel the need for speed so early in your riding career, Yamaha's MT-07 and Triumph's Trident 660 are relatively safe choices.\n\n- Triumph Street Twin 900. While well over 400 lbs, Triumph's Street Twin 900 is a very newbie friendly bike with a smooth, slow revving 900cc parallel-twin engine that puts down a lot of grunt and requires very little rev management -- you can short shift it any gear and still have the torque to move away cleanly without any fuss. Its comfortable seat and neutral \"standard\" riding position, along with its traction control and ABS features, mean that riding it is effortless and you won't be sore when you step off it after a long day cruising the backroads. It carries its weight low and close to the rider, and has a low-ish seat height of approximately 30\". Brakes are progressive without being intimidating, and a new rider will quickly learn good technique astride it. It also looks the part of a modern retro motorcycle, with clean curb appeal. Similar bikes include Moto Guzzi's V7 series, Kawasaki's Z650RS, and Royal Enfield's 650cc Interceptor.\n\n- Honda's Rebel 500. While it may not be the most eye-catching cruiser at the local Starbucks, Honda's Rebel 500 is a great gateway to the cruiser world. The 500cc engine is tuned for torque, not speed, and its low seat height of around 26\" means it is approachable by riders of all heights. It can keep up with larger bikes and serves as an effective commuter, with low costs of insurance and maintenance, and can be easily customized. Similar bikes include Royal Enfield's 350 Meteor and 650 Super Meteor, and Honda's 600cc Shadow line. For those not intimidated by weight, Harley-Davidson's 1700cc Heritage Softail is a surprisingly accommodating bike for new riders, with a low seat height and an impressive center of gravity that makes the bike feel a couple hundred pounds lighter once bumped off its kickstand. Avoid the older Sportster line, often inappropriately pitched as \"the Harley for new riders\" due to their relatively low displacements compared to KD's more upmarket models -- these bikes have very high-and-forward centers of gravity and weak front brakes that can easily inhibit your skills development.\n\nLastly, if you're looking at adventure bikes, Royal Enfield's 400cc Himalayan, Kawasaki's Versys 300X, and BMW's G310GS provide light weights, friendly engines, and reasonable seat heights all while being moderately well-equipped for gravel or graded dirt roads.\n\nThe most important thing, however, is to take the time to sit on the bikes at a dealer and think hard about the qualities discussed in this article. If you fall in love with the hobby, the bike you get today will not be the bike you have tomorrow. Focus on learning, not fashion, and make a choice that feels comfortable and safe to you.", "catgr": "gqa"}

{"instr": "What are the main two ways players score in the Princeton offense?", "ctxt": "The Princeton offense is an offensive basketball strategy which emphasizes constant motion, back-door cuts, picks on and off the ball, and disciplined teamwork. It was used and perfected at Princeton University by Pete Carril, though its roots may be traced back to Franklin \u201cCappy\u201d Cappon, who coached Princeton in the late 1930s,[1] and Bernard \"Red\" Sarachek, who coached at Yeshiva University from 1938 to 1977.[2]\n\nThe offense is designed for a unit of five players who can each pass, shoot, and dribble at an above-average level. These players hope to isolate and exploit a mismatch using these skills.[3] Positions become less important and on offense there is no point guard, shooting guard, small forward or power forward.[4] However, there are certain rules that players running this offense are expected to follow.[5]\n\nThe offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc with one player at the top of the key. The ball is kept in constant motion through passing until either a player without the ball cuts toward the unoccupied area under and around the basket, and is passed the ball for a layup. The post player is a very important player in the offense. He sets up in the high post and draws attention to his positioning. When the ball is received in to the post the players main objective is to find back door cutters or defenders who have fallen asleep on the weak side.\n\nThe hallmark of the offense is the backdoor pass, where a player on the wing suddenly moves in towards the basket, receives a bounce pass from a guard on the perimeter, and (if done correctly) finds himself with no defenders between him and a layup. Alternatively, when the defensive team attempts to pack the paint to prevent backdoor cuts, the offense utilizes three point shots from the perimeter. All five players in the offense\u2014including the center\u2014should be competent at making a three-point attempt, further spreading the floor, and not allowing the defense to leave any player unattended.\n\nThe offense is often a very slowly developing one, relying on a high number of passes, and is often used in college basketball by teams facing opponents with superior athletic talent in order to maintain a low-scoring game (believing that a high-scoring game would favor the athletically superior opponent). As a result, Princeton has led the nation in scoring defense 19 times including in every year from 1989 to 2000.[6]", "response": "The first way to score in the Princeton offense is by utilizing the backdoor pass. A backdoor pass is when someone on the wing suddenly cuts towards the basket and is passed the ball for an uncontested layup.

(later renamed Meta) for their data analysts to run interactive queries on its large data warehouse in Apache Hadoop. The first four developers were Martin Traverso, Dain Sundstrom, David Phillips, and Eric Hwang. Before Presto, the data analysts at Facebook relied on Apache Hive for running SQL analytics on their multi-petabyte data warehouse.[2] Hive was deemed too slow for Facebook's scale and Presto was invented to fill the gap to run fast queries.[3] Original development started in 2012 and deployed at Facebook later that year. In November 2013, Facebook announced its open source release.[3][4]\n\nIn 2014, Netflix disclosed they used Presto on 10 petabytes of data stored in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).[5] In November, 2016, Amazon announced a service called Athena that was based on Presto.[6] In 2017, Teradata spun out a company called Starburst Data to commercially support Presto, which included staff acquired from Hadapt in 2014.[7] Teradata's QueryGrid software allowed Presto to access a Teradata relational database.[8]\n\nIn January 2019, the Presto Software Foundation was announced.

{"instr": "What would be the summary of the story of Oedipus, which serves as the basis for the psychoanalytic theory of the Oedipus complex?", "ctxt": "The story of Oedipus is the subject of Sophocles' tragedy Oedipus Rex, which is followed in the narrative sequence by Oedipus at Colonus and then Antigone. Together, these plays make up Sophocles' three Theban plays. Oedipus represents two enduring themes of Greek myth and drama: the flawed nature of humanity and an individual's role in the course of destiny in a harsh universe.\n\nIn the best-known version of the myth, Oedipus was born to King Laius and Queen Jocasta of Thebes. Laius wished to thwart the prophecy, so he sent a shepherd-servant to leave Oedipus to die on a mountainside. However, the shepherd took pity on the baby and passed him to another shepherd who gave Oedipus to King Polybus and Queen Merope to raise as their own. Oedipus learned from the oracle at Delphi of the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother but, unaware of his true parentage, believed he was fated to murder Polybus and marry Merope, so left for Thebes. On his way, he met an older man and killed him in a quarrel. Continuing on to Thebes, he found that the king of the city (Laius) had recently been killed and that the city was at the mercy of the Sphinx. Oedipus answered the monster's riddle correctly, defeating it and winning the throne of the dead king \u2013 and the hand in marriage of the king's widow, who was also (unbeknownst to him) his mother Jocasta.\n\n\nDetail of ancient fresco in which Oedipus solves the riddle of the Sphinx.

For instance, the struggling Digital Equipment Corporation also downsized in the 1990s and was acquired by Compaq.[2]\n\nA common view within the PC community is that Wang Labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and could not compete with general-purpose personal computers with word-processing software in the 1980s. Word processing was not actually the mainstay of Wang's business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity. Although Wang manufactured desktops, its main business by the 1980s was its VS line of minicomputer and \"midframe\" systems. The market for these minicomputers was conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the Apple Macintosh and the Wintel PC and Sun, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard servers.\n\nAn Wang's insistence that his son, Fred Wang, succeed him contributed to the company's failure. Fred Wang was a business school graduate, \"but by almost any definition\", wrote Charles C. Kenney, \"unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him.\" His assignment, first as head of research and development, then as president of the company, led to resignations by key R&D and business personnel. Amid declining revenues, John F. Cunningham, an 18-year employee of the firm, resigned as president and COO of Wang Labs to become chairman and chief executive of Computer Consoles Inc. Cunningham resigned due to disagreement with An Wang on how to pull the company out of the slump, as well as being upset that Fred Wang was positioned, nepotistically, as An Wang's successor.[57][58]\n\nOne turning point occurred when Fred Wang was head of R&D. On October 4, 1983, Wang Laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery. The announcement was well received, but even at the time, there were warning signs. According to Datamation, Wang announced \"everything but the kitchen sink. And if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer, they would announce that too.\"[59] Very few of the products were close to completion, and many of them had not even been started. All were delivered late, if at all. In retrospect, this was referred to as the \"vaporware announcement,\" and it hurt the credibility of Fred Wang and Wang Laboratories.\n\nIn 1986, Fred Wang, then 36 years old, was installed as president of Wang Laboratories. However, the company's fortunes continued to decline. Unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock, An Wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company. By August 1989, that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors. On August 4, 1989, An Wang fired his son. Richard W. Miller, who had been with the company since 1988, replaced him as the president of Wang Laboratories.[58]\n\nMiller announced in December 1989 that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs. An Wang died in March 1990, and Miller took on the additional posts of chairman and CEO. The company underwent massive restructuring and eliminated its bank debt in August 1990, but it still ended the year with a record net loss.[58]\n\nIn November 1990, Wang announced their first personal computers running Unix. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington, MA-based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VS \u2013 Interactive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM 360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran \"native\" on the VS hardware soon thereafter \u2013 but performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never a good fit for the batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that \"tty\" style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its data dictionary, excellent referential integrity, and speedy application development, was in the process of being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client-server RDBMS model built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang's original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study[citation needed] suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were abandoned.\n\nIra Magaziner, who was brought in by Miller in 1990, proposed to take Wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether, and to go big into imaging software instead. In March 1991, the company introduced its Office 2000 marketing strategy, focusing on office productivity.\n\nIn June 1991, Wang started reselling IBM computers, in exchange for IBM investing in Wang stock. Wang hardware strategy to re-sell IBM RS/6000s also included further pursuit of UNIX software.\n\nIn August 1991, Wang won a suit against NEC and Toshiba claiming violation of Wang's patents on single in-line memory modules (SIMMs). The company still recorded a net loss for the 1991 fiscal year.\n\nWang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on August 18, 1992, at a time when the company's attempted concession from proprietary to open systems was deemed by some analysts as \"too little and too late", "response": "Founder An Wang forced his experienced son Fred Wang was going to lead the company after his death.", "catgr": "cloqa"}

Do you enjoy summer activities or winter activities? Do you want to see the Northern Lights or would you rather vacation under the Midnight Sun? Once you have decided when to go, you can build your itinerary around these desired activities. It's important to note that if you want to work within a budget, it's more expensive during the summer. Plane tickets, hotels, and car rentals will be pricey and oftentimes harder to reserve. On the other hand, it will be cheaper to visit Alaska in the winter, as you will have more hotel options available to you, but fewer flight options, and you will need to have winter driving experience if you rent a car.\n\nIn the summertime, you will get to experience the state in full bloom -- pun intended. Because Alaska gets more direct sunlight during this time of year, everything grows big and fast. The best months for a summertime visit are late May, June, and July. The further north you go, the more sunlight you will have, with 24 hours of full sun in Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow). There are plenty of places to go hiking, fishing, camping, and hunting. Don't forget to bring bug spray, as the mosquitoes are huge and plentiful; you'll also likely encounter \"no-see-ums\" which are tiny biting midges that can swarm you. In Anchorage, the biggest city, you can rent a bicycle to ride the hundreds of miles of trails within the municipality. Keep in mind that despite the extra sun exposure, you'll likely encounter cold and rainy weather, so bring a rain jacket.\n\nIn the wintertime, you will have the opportunity to see the Northern Lights. The further north you are, the chances are higher that you will see them. When it's very cold and clear out, and if you're away from city light pollution, you're almost guaranteed to see a beautiful display in the night sky. While you might not have much success camping or fishing, you can still do other activities like skiing and snowboarding at the world-famous Alyeska resort, ice skating on many public-use ponds and lakes, and perhaps catch the ceremonial start of the Iditarod dog race in February. Don't forget to bring lots of warm clothes and to layer up from head-to-toe. Average December temperatures across Alaska vary from a low of 27F in Juneau to -20F in Tok, but it isn't unusual for temperatures to drop much, much further.\n\nMany people don't realize that Alaska is a very, very big state. Don't try to cram too many activities into a short amount of time and give yourself plenty of time to travel to your intended destinations. There most reliable transportation is either a car or plane; there is not a well-developed rail system nor other public transport system. Some car rental company won't let you drive to certain areas because of inherent highway dangers, such as unpaved, gravel roads, isolation, and animal dangers. You'll encounter delays on roads in the summer due to road construction and delays in the winter due to accidents, ice, and blizzards.\n\nNo matter what time of year you go, there will be plenty to see and do in Alaska. Just remember to plan ahead, budget accordingly, dress appropriately for the weather, and build some flexibility into your itinerary to accommodate for delays or unexpected changes.", "catgr": ""cwt"}

Texas Hold'em is one of those rulesets. In Texas Hold'em players are first dealt two secret cards each, followed by a betting round, then three open, public cards are dealt (the flop), with a subsequent betting round. The flop is followed by the turn, one more public card, and then a betting round. The turn is followed by the river, the final public card. A last betting round follows, and if more than one player is still in the hand at the end, the winner of that round is determined. \n\nThe last player who bet on the river reveals his two secret cards, and makes the best poker hand out of the two secret cards and five public cards. Any other player who is still in the game may then reveal his two secret cards and make a better poker hand with the seven cards total if possible.", "catgr": "gqa"}

I have a request I would like to ask of you.\n\nAs you know, I live alone. I have been considering getting a pet for companionship, but after reviewing my rental contract, I noticed the only permitted animals are small dogs and animals that can be kept in a tank, like hamsters and fish.\n\nI am hoping you would reconsider these restrictions and allow me to have a cat. I am more than willing to resign a rental contract to include the requisite pet deposit and pet rent.\n\nI thought about a dog, since those animals are already in the contract, but I don't want a dog. Since I work long hours, it's not ideal to have a dog in my unit. My unit is small and could be claustrophobic for a dog who has a lot of energy. I also don't want to leave a dog alone because it may bark and disturb the other tenants in the building. Dogs also urinate and defecate in the shared yard around the property, which is gross, considering not everyone picks up after their dogs. Also, I am allergic to dogs, so this rules out dogs.\n\nI also considered a hamster or fish, but I am reluctant to have either of those, as well. Firstly, they do not offer the same cuddly companionship of a cat. If a hamster got loose, it could cause far more damage to a unit than a cat could -- the hamster could defecate in many areas, chew electrical wires, and chew through drywall. Fish pose a problem if the tank cracks or breaks, which would cause lots of water damage to the flooring.\n\nI recognize there are drawbacks to any pet, including cats, and I understand that some landlords are reluctant to permit cats, because there is an impression that cats may be more destructive, such as peeing in inappropriate places. However, I believe a cat is the least-destructive option of all. As my unit is not carpeted, I don't believe persistent urination stains will be an issue. Cats are easy to litter box train and I plan to put the litter box in the tiled bathroom where there is no opportunity for urine to get into the subfloor. Cats are less destructive than dogs, because they don't chew on things like furniture and doorways. Cats also are not nearly as loud as barking dogs. \n\nI have already looked into pets at the local animal shelter and found a possible new roommate, who is a friendly two-year-old cat and is housebroken and box-trained. This is an ideal pet, since I don't have to risk accidents with box-training a kitten, and it's unlikely the cat will be destructive if it's already housebroken.\n\nI believe a cat would be the ideal companion for me, given my work schedule and my preference for my ideal pet. I am happy to discuss my desire in person and further elaborate my plan on how I will continue to maintain a clean and tidy unit with a cat, such as purchasing an automatic robot vacuum and mop to ensure an extra clean space.\n\nPlease consider my request.

{"instr": "What is the relationship between Link and Zelda?", "ctxt": "Link[c] is a fictional character and the protagonist of Nintendo's video game franchise The Legend of Zelda. He was created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Link was introduced as the hero of the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game and has appeared in a total of 19 entries in the series, as well as a number of spin-offs. Common elements in the series include Link travelling through Hyrule whilst exploring dungeons, battling creatures and solving puzzles until he eventually defeats the series' primary antagonist, Ganon, and saves Princess Zelda.\n\nThroughout The Legend of Zelda series, Link has made multiple appearances in a variety of incarnations. He has been rendered in both 2D and 3D form and has been traditionally depicted in his signature green cap and tunic carrying a sword and shield. Over the course of the series, he appears as a child or young adult of the Hylian race, which originates from the fictional kingdom of Hyrule. Within Zelda lore, Link is the soul of a legendary hero that throughout history is reincarnated within a seemingly ordinary boy or man when the need arises for a new warrior to defeat the forces of evil. To defeat Ganon, Link usually obtains the mystical Master Sword or a similar legendary weapon, which is obtained after completing various trials. Over the course of his journey, he also acquires other magical items, including musical instruments and other weaponry.\n\nIn addition to the main series, Link has appeared in other Nintendo media, including merchandise, comics and manga, and an animated television series. He is a prominent character in various spin-off games, including Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. He has appeared in entries of several other game franchises, including the Super Smash Bros. series, SoulCalibur II and Mario Kart 8, and has also been referenced in other games, such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\n\nAlongside fellow Nintendo character Mario, Link is one of the most recognisable characters in the video game industry. He has been instrumental in the establishment of the role-playing video game genre as the protagonist of the series, which has influenced numerous other video games with its concepts of open world and nonlinear gameplay. According to Guinness World Records, Link is the most critically acclaimed videogame playable character and the most ubiquitous action-adventure video game character, surpassing Mario. He has been recognised by the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition as the second best video game character of all time after Mario. Critics have also named him as one of the most influential video game characters of all time and one of Shigeru Miyamoto's most famous creations.\n\nLink is a brave, skilled warrior and the hero of The Legend of Zelda series. Over the course of the series, he has appeared in a variety of ages and forms, ranging from child to young adult, and in Twilight Princess, also appears in the form of a wolf.[39][40] He displays the characteristic traits of the Hylian race, being of human form with elfin features, including pointed ears. Since the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game, he has been repeatedly depicted wearing his characteristic green cap and tunic.[41] He has also appeared wearing other outfits, including a blue lobster shirt in The Wind Waker and his blue Champion's Tunic in Breath of the Wild.[42] Link is described in the original game's instruction manual as a \"young lad\" and a traveller[43] and in later games, such as Breath of the Wild, as a knight of Hyrule who is sworn to protect the kingdom and Princess Zelda.[44] During gameplay, he carries a sword and a shield, but has also wielded a variety of other weapons, including bows, spears and axes.[45]\n\nLink's signature weapon is the Master Sword, a powerful magic sword that has the ability to repel evil.[46] He is also often depicted holding the Hylian Shield. These two components have become integral aspects of the character's identity.[47] Each game in the series follows a similar story arc in which Link must take a journey that eventually leads him to recover the Master Sword, which makes him stronger in gameplay and enables him to defeat the series' main antagonist, Ganon.[46]\n\nThroughout each game, Link is able to obtain various items during his adventures, which the player can then use in gameplay. Many of these objects possess magical properties that bestow specific abilities on Link, such as a magic cape that makes Link invisible when he wears it, or potions that replenish his health. Others have various practical purposes, such as the hookshot, which enables Link to pull items towards him, and bombs for detonation. Link has used various musical instruments on his travels, most notably, the Ocarina of Time, which when played is used for teleportation.[48] In Breath of the Wild, Link's key tool is the Sheikah Slate, a handheld tablet featuring various runes that enable him to manipulate the game world.[49]\n\nIn Zelda lore, Link is the reincarnated soul of a hero, chosen by the goddess Hylia to protect the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon and save Princess Zelda whenever the need arises.[50] As the goddess' chosen hero, he is also the bearer of the Triforce of Courage, one of the three components that combine to form the Triforce, a sacred artefact and symbol of power. In several Zelda games, Link's main objective is to recover the fragments of the Triforce in order to defeat Ganon.[51] Link's character is always depicted as a fearless hero and a \"symbol of courage\" who is willing to protect Hyrule for the sake of others.[14]\n\nRelationships\nLink's relationships with the other main characters has been a defining aspect of the series. Within the fictional lore, Ganon, Zelda and Link represent three pieces of the Triforce, with Ganon representing Power, Zelda representing Wisdom and Link representing Courage. This trinity transcends the fictional timeline and dictates that the three characters are destined to be forever reincarnated in an endless battle for good and evil. Link's battle with Ganon established a fictional chronology that spans across the entire series and branches into three separate timelines. The three timelines originate at the end of Ocarina of Time when the timeline splits according to whether Link successfully defeats Ganon (\"The Hero is Victorious\") or fails to stop him (the \"Fallen Hero\" timeline).[52] The official fictional chronology was revealed in Hyrule Historia, with Skyward Sword presented as the first game in the timeline. Skyward Sword establishes that the three main characters are destined to be connected in an endless cycle after the antagonist Demise curses Link and Zelda.[53]\n\nLink's relationship with Zelda has been a core aspect of the series but has also been the subject of speculation. Throughout the games, the storylines have suggested the possibility of a romantic relationship between the two, but this has remained ambiguous. With each game release, the nature of their relationship has varied and Link has also been presented with other possible love interests. A romantic relationship between Link and Zelda is particularly evident in Skyward Sword and was also emphasised in an official \"romance trailer\" for the game. Aonuma commented on this relationship in an interview with Game Informer: \"As far as the love story goes, it wasn't that we wanted to create a romance between Link and Zelda as much as we wanted the player to feel like this is a person who's very important to me, who I need to find. We used that hint of a romance between the two to tug at the heartstrings\".[54] In Breath of the Wild, the relationship between Link and Zelda is more complex and follows a story arc that begins with resentment and ends in a close bond with each willing to give their life for the other.[55]", "response": "Link's relationship with Zelda has been developing as the story flows. In lore, Link, Zelda, and Ganon (the evil) represent three pieces Triforce, corresponding to Courage, Wisdom, and Power, respectively. The three are destined connected in an endless cycle.\nPeople speculate that Link and Zelda are in a possible romantic relationship. Although not told by the story, there is evidence in and out of the games that this relationship is true. The game producer, Eiji Aonuma, once said otherwise that it was not their intention to create a romantic relationship between the two, but to the most important person for each other.", "catgr": "smzt"}

The use of government revenue expenditures to influence macroeconomic variables developed in reaction to the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the previous laissez-faire approach to economic management became unworkable. Fiscal policy is based on the theories of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, whose Keynesian economics theorised that government changes in the levels of taxation and government spending influence aggregate demand and the level of economic activity. Fiscal and monetary policy are the key strategies used by a country's government and central bank to advance its economic objectives. The combination of these policies enables these authorities to target inflation (which is considered \"healthy\" at the level in the range 2%\u20133%) and to increase employment. Additionally, it is designed to try to keep GDP growth at 2%\u20133% and the unemployment rate near the natural unemployment rate of 4%\u20135%.[1] This implies that fiscal policy is used to stabilise the economy over the course of the business cycle.[2]\n\nChanges in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can affect macroeconomic variables, including:\n\naggregate demand and the level of economic activity\nsaving and investment\nincome distribution\nallocation of resources.\nFiscal policy can be distinguished from monetary policy, in that fiscal policy deals with taxation and government spending and is often administered by a government department; while monetary policy deals with the money supply, interest rates and is often administered by a country's central bank.

{"instr": "Extract the pros and cons of different speech synthesis technologies.", "ctxt": "The most important qualities of a speech synthesis system are naturalness and intelligibility.[28] Naturalness describes how closely the output sounds like human speech, while intelligibility is the ease with which the output is understood. The ideal speech synthesizer is both natural and intelligible. Speech synthesis systems usually try to maximize both characteristics.\n\nThe two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms are concatenative synthesis and formant synthesis. Each technology has strengths and weaknesses, and the intended uses of a synthesis system will typically determine which approach is used.\n\nConcatenation synthesis\nMain article: Concatenative synthesis\nConcatenative synthesis is based on the concatenation (stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. Generally, concatenative synthesis produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, differences between natural variations in speech and the nature of the automated techniques for segmenting the waveforms sometimes result in audible glitches in the output. There are three main sub-types of concatenative synthesis.\n\nUnit selection synthesis\nUnit selection synthesis uses large databases of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual phones, diphones, half-phones, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences. Typically, the division into segments is done using a specially modified speech recognizer set to a \"forced alignment\" mode with some manual correction afterward, using visual representations such as the waveform and spectrogram.[29] An index of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the fundamental frequency (pitch), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At run time, the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). This process is typically achieved using a specially weighted decision tree.\n\nUnit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies only a small amount of digital signal processing (DSP) to the recorded speech. DSP often makes recorded speech sound less natural, although some systems use a small amount of signal processing at the point of concatenation to smooth the waveform. The output from the best unit-selection systems is often indistinguishable from real human voices, especially in contexts for which the TTS system has been tuned. However, maximum naturalness typically require unit-selection speech databases to be very large, in some systems ranging into the gigabytes of recorded data, representing dozens of hours of speech.[30] Also, unit selection algorithms have been known to select segments from a place that results in less than ideal synthesis (e.g. minor words become unclear) even when a better choice exists in the database.[31] Recently, researchers have proposed various automated methods to detect unnatural segments in unit-selection speech synthesis systems.[32]\n\nDiphone synthesis\nDiphone synthesis uses a minimal speech database containing all the diphones (sound-to-sound transitions) occurring in a language. The number of diphones depends on the phonotactics of the language: for example, Spanish has about 800 diphones, and German about 2500. In diphone synthesis, only one example of each diphone is contained in the speech database. At runtime, the target prosody of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of digital signal processing techniques such as linear predictive coding, PSOLA[33] or MBROLA.[34] or more recent techniques such as pitch modification in the source domain using discrete cosine transform.[35] Diphone synthesis suffers from the sonic glitches of concatenative synthesis and the robotic-sounding nature of formant synthesis, and has few of the advantages of either approach other than small size. As such, its use in commercial applications is declining,[citation needed] although it continues to be used in research because there are a number of freely available software implementations. An early example of Diphone synthesis is a teaching robot, Leachim, that was invented by Michael J. Freeman.[36] Leachim contained information regarding class curricular and certain biographical information about the students whom it was programmed to teach.[37] It was tested in a fourth grade classroom in the Bronx, New York.[38][39]\n\nDomain-specific synthesis\nDomain-specific synthesis concatenates prerecorded words and phrases to create complete utterances. It is used in applications where the variety of texts the system will output is limited to a particular domain, like transit schedule announcements or weather reports.[40] The technology is very simple to implement, and has been in commercial use for a long time, in devices like talking clocks and calculators. The level of naturalness of these systems can be very high because the variety of sentence types is limited, and they closely match the prosody and intonation of the original recordings.[citation needed]\n\nBecause these systems are limited by the words and phrases in their databases, they are not general-purpose and can only synthesize the combinations of words and phrases with which they have been preprogrammed. The blending of words within naturally spoken language however can still cause problems unless the many variations are taken into account. For example, in non-rhotic dialects of English the \"r\" in words like \"clear\" /\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259/ is usually only pronounced when the following word has a vowel as its first letter (e.g. \"clear out\" is realized as /\u02cckl\u026a\u0259\u0279\u02c8\u028c\u028at/). Likewise in French, many final consonants become no longer silent if followed by a word that begins with a vowel, an effect called liaison. This alternation cannot be reproduced by a simple word-concatenation system, which would require additional complexity to be context-sensitive.\n\nFormant synthesis\nFormant synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime. Instead, the synthesized speech output is created using additive synthesis and an acoustic model (physical modelling synthesis).[41] Parameters such as fundamental frequency, voicing, and noise levels are varied over time to create a waveform of artificial speech. This method is sometimes called rules-based synthesis; however, many concatenative systems also have rules-based components. Many systems based on formant synthesis technology generate artificial, robotic-sounding speech that would never be mistaken for human speech. However, maximum naturalness is not always the goal of a speech synthesis system, and formant synthesis systems have advantages over concatenative systems. Formant-synthesized speech can be reliably intelligible, even at very high speeds, avoiding the acoustic glitches that commonly plague concatenative systems. High-speed synthesized speech is used by the visually impaired to quickly navigate computers using a screen reader. Formant synthesizers are usually smaller programs than concatenative systems because they do not have a database of speech samples. They can therefore be used in embedded systems, where memory and microprocessor power are especially limited. Because formant-based systems have complete control of all aspects of the output speech, a wide variety of prosodies and intonations can be output, conveying not just questions and statements, but a variety of emotions and tones of voice.\n\nExamples of non-real-time but highly accurate intonation control in formant synthesis include the work done in the late 1970s for the Texas Instruments toy Speak & Spell, and in the early 1980s Sega arcade machines[42] and in many Atari, Inc. arcade games[43] using the TMS5220 LPC Chips. Creating proper intonation for these projects was painstaking, and the results have yet to be matched by real-time text-to-speech interfaces.[44]\n\nArticulatory synthesis\nArticulatory synthesis refers to computational techniques for synthesizing speech based on models of the human vocal tract and the articulation processes occurring there. The first articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at Haskins Laboratories in the mid-1970s by Philip Rubin, Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY, was based on vocal tract models developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues.\n\nUntil recently, articulatory synthesis models have not been incorporated into commercial speech synthesis systems. A notable exception is the NeXT-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the University of Calgary, where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of NeXT (started by Steve Jobs in the late 1980s and merged with Apple Computer in 1997), the Trillium software was published under the GNU General Public License, with work continuing as gnuspeech. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Carr\u00e9's \"distinctive region model\".\n\nMore recent synthesizers, developed by Jorge C. Lucero and colleagues, incorporate models of vocal fold biomechanics, glottal aerodynamics and acoustic wave propagation in the bronchi, trachea, nasal and oral cavities, and thus constitute full systems of physics-based speech simulation.[45][46]", "response": "The two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms are concatenative synthesis and formant synthesis.\n\nConcatenative synthesis is based on stringing together segments of recorded speech.

It was historically associated with a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a fiasco (\"flask\"; pl. fiaschi). However, the fiasco is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. In the mid-late 19th century, Baron Bettino Ricasoli (later Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy) helped establish Sangiovese as the blend's dominant grape variety, creating the blueprint for today's Chianti wines.[1]\n\nThe first definition of a wine area called Chianti was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of Gaiole, Castellina and Radda; the so-called Lega del Chianti and later Provincia del Chianti (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely redrawn and divided into seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and R\u00f9fina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were added to the newly defined Chianti Classico region added in Chianti to their names, for example Greve in Chianti, which amended its name in 1972. Wines labelled Chianti Classico come from the largest sub-area of Chianti, which includes the original Chianti heartland. Only Chianti from this sub-zone may display the black rooster (gallo nero) seal on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Chianti Classico Consortium, the local association of producers.[2][3] Other variants, with the exception of Rufina north-east of Florence and Montalbano south of Pistoia, originate in the named provinces: Siena for the Colli Senesi, Florence for the Colli Fiorentini, Arezzo for the Colli Aretini and Pisa for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed Montespertoli.\n\nDuring the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes.[4] Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4\u20137) may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, higher alcohol content and dry extract) may be labelled as Chianti Superiore, although Chianti from the Classico sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as Superiore.", "response": "Chianti wine is any kind of wine made in the Chianti region of Tuscany, Italy.

She was known as The President among his friends due to having the same unusual name as a former president. The President knew Larry Joe was going to propose: they had shopped for rings together and she had even reserved a venue. In order to make his proposal a surprise, Larry Joe was going to have to do things a little out-of-the-ordinary.\nHis plan was to have a party with all of their friends, swimming in the lake behind his house. Having such a casual party helped reduce any suspicion that The President might have, plus Larry Joe had thrown such parties before. In order to make things special, he bought a dozen bottles of champagne and food for after the proposal. And to make things memorable, he would shout his proposal while flying over the lake on the rope swing! His plan was coming together.\nThe day of the party had arrived and the guests started showing up. The President was wearing her bikini and swam to the floating dock. Larry Joe took his friend Smoochy aside and whispered something in his ear. Everyone was having a good time, enjoying the warm water and cold beverages. But suddenly a low rumble of thunder rolled in from a distance. Larry Joe decided he better make his proposal now. \nHe climbed up on the platform with the rope and yelled, \"it's time for the presidential address!\" This was the code that sent Smoochy running up to the house to retrieve the ring, which had been hidden in the computer desk inside. Larry Joe then leapt off the platform and swung out over the water. He yelled, \"President, will you marry me?\", then dove into the water. At this point, all but the select few friends who knew of the upcoming proposal were caught off guard, most especially The President.\nLarry Joe then swam over to the dock where The President was laying in the sun, and she said, \"is this really happening?\" Larry Joe replied, \"yes!\" He then climbed out of the water as Smoochy came back down the stairs with the ring box in hand. Larry Joe took The President by the hand over to the trees and knelt down in the traditional manner and once more repeated his proposal: \"President, will you marry me?\", then he handed her the ring box.\nNow you must understand that this ring box was quite unique. It had been hand-made by Larry Joe out of wood, in the shape of a rhombic dodecahedron. In fact, the box was actually a puzzle box, and required a special, awkward three-fingered grip to open. And the two halves fit so well together that you couldn't even see the seam. The President looked the beautiful box over trying to find a way to open it without luck. She handed the box back to him saying, \"I don't know how to open it!\" Larry Joe then twirled it around, found the seam, and carefully slid the two halves open. He removed the ring and placed it on The President's finger. And finally, she tearfully said \"YES!\" and kissed him.\nThe party then moved up to the house and the champagne flowed. The President excitedly called her parents and more friends to come and join the celebration. She beamed with joy, showing off her ring to everyone. Larry Joe likewise had a grin from ear to ear: his crazy plan, a perfect reflection of his personality, had come off without a hitch and he was now engaged to his best friend.", "catgr": ""cwt"}

{"instr": "What is the best method for setting up to hit a golf shot approach to a green?", "ctxt": "", "response": "When a golfer is setting up to hit a golf short, there are several things they need to take into account. First, they need to understand what club to hit based on the distance to the green, the elevation, wind speed and possibly the contours of the green. For beginning golfers, focusing on the center of the green is probably easiest. More skilled golfers should target areas closer to the pin or that leave them an easier putt or chip. The second step is lining up the shot. It's usually best to approach from the behind the ball to make sure your legs and body are aligned to the target. The target (pin, tree, etc) should take into account a golfers natural tendency to either draw (right to left) or fade (left to right) the ball as well as the direction and strength of the wind. The golfers stance will also affect the trajectory of a ball. If the golfers feet are above the ball or the ball is on a downhill lie, the ball will tend to go to the right. If the golfers feet are below the ball or the ball is on an uphill lie, the ball  will tend to go to the left. For left handed golfers, simple reverse the descriptions.", "catgr": ""cwt"}

Nonetheless, Mehmed II viewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of the Roman Empire for the remainder of his life, seeing himself as \"continuing\" the Empire rather than \"replacing\" it.\n\nMehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. At home he made many political and social reforms, encouraged the arts and sciences, and by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed Constantinople into a thriving imperial capital.

It was just him in that tiny little house, by the great big pond. He looked up at the moon and wondered who else lived up there.

These include mechanical approaches such as using high pressures and low temperatures, or employing chemical compounds that release H2 upon demand. While large amounts of hydrogen are produced by various industries, it is mostly consumed at the site of production, notably for the synthesis of ammonia. For many years hydrogen has been stored as compressed gas or cryogenic liquid, and transported as such in cylinders, tubes, and cryogenic tanks for use in industry or as propellant in space programs. Interest in using hydrogen for on-board storage of energy in zero-emissions vehicles is motivating the development of new methods of storage, more adapted to this new application. The overarching challenge is the very low boiling point of H2: it boils around 20.268 K (\u2212252.882 \u00b0C or \u2212423.188 \u00b0F).

As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.\nSunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages. The first one is civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon. The second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon. The third phase is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night. Finally, night occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.\nLocations further north than the Arctic Circle and further south than the Antarctic Circle experience no full sunset or sunrise on at least one day of the year, when the polar day or the polar night persists continuously for 24 hours.", "response": "Sunset can be viewed from everywhere on Earth except the North and South poles.", "catgr":"infet"}

Rome nonetheless managed to win the Second Punic War thanks to Scipio Africanus in 201 BC. After its defeat, Carthage ceased to be a threat to Rome and was reduced to a small territory that was equivalent to what is now northeastern Tunisia.\n\nHowever, Cato the Censor visited Carthage in 152 BC as a member of a senatorial embassy, which was sent to arbitrate a conflict between the Punic city and Massinissa, the king of Numidia. Cato, a veteran of the Second Punic War, was shocked by Carthage's wealth, which he considered dangerous for Rome. He then relentlessly called for its destruction and ended all of his speeches with the phrase, even when the debate was on a completely different matter.[2] The Senate refused to follow him though, especially Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum, the son-in-law of Scipio Africanus and the most influential senator. Corculum opposed the war to preserve Roman unity and argued that the fear of a common enemy was necessary to keep the people in check.[3] Like Cato, he ended all his speeches with the same phrase, \"Carthage must be saved\" (Carthago servanda est).[4][5][6]", "response": "Cato felt that Carthage had bounced back too quickly from its defeats in the first two Punic wars, and would have remembered the disastrous defeat at Cannae.

{"instr": "From this passage, find out who controls the Panama Canal", "ctxt": "The Panama Canal is an artificial 82 km (51 mi) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean and divides North and South America. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan.\n\nColombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The United States took over the project on May 4, 1904, and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama. After a period of joint American\u2013Panamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.\n\nCanal locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 33.5 meters (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded waterway began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, New Panamax ships.\n\nAnnual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal. In 2017 it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal's two locks.

The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[13] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[14]\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[15]\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[16] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[15][17] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[18] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[19]\n\n\nThe YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007; it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010. Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital\u2013funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital, $11.5 million, and Artis Capital Management, $8 million, being the largest two.[13][20] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[21] In February 2005, the company activated www.youtube.com.[22] The first video was uploaded April 23, 2005. Titled Me at the zoo, it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[23][24] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[25][26] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[27][28] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[29]\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor at the time and did not grow much, either.[30] The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's Saturday Night Live ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for Saturday Night Live, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[31] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[32] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[33][34] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[35]\n\nThe choice of the name www.youtube.com led to problems for a similarly named website, www.utube.com. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube.

{"instr": "Summarize how tourism impacted Hawaii in a variety of areas", "ctxt": "Impacts of tourism in Hawaii\nEconomic\nAs Hawaii changed from a Kingdom to a Territory to a State, so too did the dominant industries change. Being a primarily agricultural land, producing around 80 percent of the world's pineapples in the 1960s,[120] the addition of Pan Am\u2019s flight route to Hawaii rapidly increased the number of visitors going to the islands. The years following statehood led to more than double the number of passengers arriving at Honolulu airport.[121] As this trend continues to increase, Hawaii's economy has become heavily dependent on the tourism industry. Although the economy has seen significant growth with the addition of this industry, some researchers believe this will leave Hawaii susceptible to external economic forces. Some examples of these are an economic recession, airline strikes, or varying fuel prices which could devastate the local economy.[122] The devastating national economic recession of 2008, hit Hawaii's tourism industry hard. In 2008, hotel occupancy dropped to 60 percent, a level not seen since the terrorist attacks in 2001.[123]\n\nAs the economy has returned to normal levels, the tourism industry has continued to grow in Hawaii with the majority of tourists visiting Oahu, Maui, Kauai and the big island of Hawaii.[124] Job creation is another benefit of tourism to the islands. In 2017, reports say 204,000 jobs were related to tourism. This led to $16.78 billion in visitor spending with $1.96 billion generated in tax revenue in that year alone.[125] Resorts and the airline business are the primary benefactors of this increase in tourism.\n\nEnvironmental\nThe Sustainable Tourism Association of Hawaii (formerly the Hawaii Ecotourism Association) was founded in 1995 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to nurture the development of sustainable tourism in Hawaii. It offers a certification program to educate and recognize conservation-minded tour operators in Hawaii, the only such certification program of its kind in America.[126]\n\nThe long term environmental implications that Hawaii is facing due to mass tourism has raised concern. To combat this and help raise awareness, international environmental organizations have joined forces with local island communities. There are major benefits to this type of management, usually described as \"values-led management\".[127] By prioritizing the values and existing sustainable practices by local communities living on heavily visited islands, it preserves their interests and further respects their culture.\n\nWater\nHotels are often placed near beaches, in areas with little rainfall, and guests use 2,000 to 10,000 litres (440 to 2,200 imp gal; 530 to 2,640 US gal) of water per person.[128] Another study concluded that on average, a single guest uses approximately 1,300 to 3,600 litres (290 to 790 imp gal; 340 to 950 US gal) of water per day, divided approximately half between accommodations (laundry and sewer) and golf courses (irrigation).[129] This is significantly more than the average resident and has led to a number of droughts throughout the islands.\n\nLandscape\nThe number of hotel rooms from 1985 to 2010 nearly doubled from 65,000 to 132,000 rooms.[130] Tourists visit destinations with developed infrastructure, groomed activities and pristine conditions, which boosts the economy and finances needed to uphold these facilities. On the other hand, the very creation of these institutions degrades the environmental factors tourists are drawn to.[131] Having perfect conditions requires an amount of upkeep fueled by the revenue of the visitors but the visitors also degrade the environment at a faster rate than residents alone.\n\nA direct effect of the increase in infrastructure is the depletion of the natural landscape. As buildings are constructed the amount of natural land becomes smaller and smaller. As hotels are constructed in prime real estate the environmental problems created are not weighed equally with the potential upside of profit.[130] The government sees the creation of jobs and the increase in visitor spending in the state as a good thing. Those are quantitative variables that can be directly measured in terms of dollars and number of jobs. However, the impact to the environment or the indigenous people is harder to measure in term of absolutes. Hawaii only holds 0.2 percent of the United States land but has a 72.1 percent extinction rate, and more than half of the natural communities in the islands are endangered by developments.[122] An example of this is natural ponds being destroyed during construction of large buildings which were previously home to migrating birds. The ponds are no longer there, which throws off the natural flow of the ecosystem. Another staggering statistic says that nearly 60 percent of the plant and animal species in Hawaii are endangered.[130] This includes the loss of habitats for animals and the diverse flora that gives Hawaii its beauty being degraded at an alarming rate.\n\nEnergy\nMain article: Energy in Hawaii\nHawaii has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-fired thermal power plants for its electricity generation, although it has set a statewide goal of achieving 100% of electric generation via renewable sources by 2045;[132] as a result, the average guest uses the equivalent of 6.4 to 13 kilograms (14 to 29 lb) of oil per day, approximately 2\u20443 of which is consumed by rental car operation. For electricity alone, the average guest uses 23.9 to 33.6 kW-hr per day.[129]\n\nRefuse\nThe beaches in Hawaii are becoming increasingly filled with trash, especially plastics. This becomes a problem not only environmentally, but also could have a negative impact on the economy as visitors come for the sandy beaches and pollutants such as trash or plastics decrease the appeal of Hawaii as a vacation destination. Kamilo Beach on the southeastern tip of the island of Hawaii has acquired the nickname \"Plastic Beach\" for its accumulation of plastic trash, much of it borne via ocean currents and trade winds from the nearby Great Pacific garbage patch. It is estimated that 15 to 20 short tons (14 to 18 t) of trash, 96% of which is plastic, washes ashore here annually.[133]\n\nThe average guest generates approximately 3.3 kilograms (7.3 lb) of waste per day.[129] In order to reduce the generation of plastic waste, Hawaii has begun to ban the use of single-use plastic and polystyrene foam on a county-by-county approach. A ban on polystyrene foam containers took effect in Maui County on December 31, 2018;[134][135] a similar ban started in Hawaii County (the Big Island) on July 1, 2019.[136][137] Oahu's ban on single-use plastic and polystyrene will take effect on January 1, 2021.[138] Two bills were considered by the Hawaii State Legislature in early 2019, which would have been the first state-wide bans on food service plastics in America.[139] SB367 would ban the use of polystrene foam food containers statewide; that bill died in committee in March 2019.[140] SB522 would ban single-use plastic beverage bottles, utensils, stirring sticks, polystyrene foam containers, and straws starting in 2021; that bill was modified in committee to create a working group to make recommendations on how to reduce plastic waste instead.[141]\n\nSocial effect\nSome Native Hawaiians believe strongly in the independence of Hawaii and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. The creation of this grassroots organization leads to a negative view towards visitors and the disruption of the natural land. This leads to a strong contention between developers and natives who believe the land should not be transformed into a commercial or residential development. Many of these individuals are reliant on the land as a means of living. The loss of the environment affects the socio-psychological well-being of those reliant on land and marine resources.[122] Native Hawaiians and residents alike become limited in job opportunities with a heavily skewed job-base in the tourism industry.[130]\n\nThe essay \"Lovely Hula Lands\" (later republished as \"Lovely Hula Hands\") by native Hawaiian academic and activist Haunani-Kay Trask is severely critical of the huge influx of tourists to Hawai\u02bbi, which she terms a \"prostitution\" of Hawaiian culture. She ends her essay with \"let me just leave this thought behind. If you are thinking of visiting my homeland, please don't. We don't want or need any more tourists, and we certainly don't like them.\"[142][143] However, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has condemned Trask for her anti-American statements, stating that such vitriol helps fuel racism in Hawai\u02bbi.[144]", "response": "- From economic perspective, tourism shifted Hawaii from being primarily agricultural and self-sustainable to heavily dependent on tourism industries and more susceptible on external economic forces such as economic recession or fuel prices. Increasing number of jobs and state income are coming from tourism-related businesses\n- On environmental perspective, the state of Hawaii established certification program to educate local communities to practice sustainable and conservation-minded tour operators\n- On the resource perspective, water, landscape and energy usage increased significantly and led to concerns on reduced natural habitats for birds and animals\n- On the refuse management perspective, trashes, especially plastics, became a major concern both environmentally and economically. Hawaii passed state laws in 2019 and 2021 to ban using plastics in food service, beverage bottles, utensils, stirring sticks, polystyrene foam containers, and straws. These are the first state-wide bans on food service plastics in America. \n- On social effect perspective, there are tensions between Native Hawaiians and residents who hold negative views towards tourism and visitors and the increasingly booming tourism industry.", "catgr": "smzt"}
{"instr": "Please give me a short bulleted list of key points about Ethiopia?", "ctxt": "Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in Africa,[1] the emergence of Ethiopian civilization dates back thousands of years. Due to migration and imperial expansion, it grew to include many other primarily Afro-Asiatic-speaking communities, including Amhara, Oromos, Somalis, Tigray, Afars, Sidama, Gurage, Agaw and Harari, among others. One of the first kingdoms to rise to power in the territory was the kingdom of D'mt in the 10th century BC, which established its capital at Yeha. In the first century AD the Aksumite Kingdom rose to power in the Tigray Region with its capital at Aksum and grew into a major power on the Red Sea, subjugating Yemen and Meroe. In the early fourth century, during the reign of Ezana, Christianity was declared the state religion. Ezana's reign is also when the Aksumites first identified themselves as \"Ethiopians\", and not long after, Philostorgius became the first foreign author to call the Aksumites Ethiopians.[2] The Aksumite empire fell into decline with the rise of Islam in the Arabian peninsula, which slowly shifted trade away from the Christian Aksum. It eventually became isolated, its economy slumped and Aksum's commercial domination of the region ended.[3] The Aksumites gave way to the Zagwe dynasty, who established a new capital at Lalibela before giving way to the Solomonic dynasty in the 13th century. During the early Solomonic period, Ethiopia went through military reforms and imperial expansion that allowed it to dominate the Horn of Africa.

During an emergency or other loss of power, helicopter pilots auto-rotate.  Auto-rotation is the decoupling of the rotor system from the engines to allow upward air flow to drive the rotor system at a faster than normal rate, providing kinetic energy that can be traded to arrest the helicopter's rate of descent.  To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing.", "catgr": "gqa"}

In his essay Bureaucracy, published in his magnum opus Economy and Society, Weber described many ideal-typical forms of public administration, government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:\n- hierarchical organization\n- formal lines of authority (chain of command)\n- a fixed area of activity\n- rigid division of labor\n- regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks\n- all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations\n- officials with expert training in their fields\n- career advancement dependent on technical qualifications\n- qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals\nWeber listed several preconditions for the emergence of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a monetary economy requiring a more efficient administrative system. The development of communication and transportation technologies makes more efficient administration possible, and democratization and rationalization of culture results in demands for equal treatment. Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to rational-legal authority, indispensable to the modern world. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalization of Western society. Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless \"iron cage\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.

A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes as well as its hierarchical, three-dimensional structural configuration. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organism's genes, their interrelations and influence on the organism. Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain.\n\nThe field also includes studies of intragenomic (within the genome) phenomena such as epistasis (effect of one gene on another), pleiotropy (one gene affecting more than one trait), heterosis (hybrid vigour), and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome.", "catgr": "clfc"}

There are several competing claims as to who created the first cheeseburger. Lionel Sternberger is reputed to have introduced the cheeseburger in 1924 at the age of 16. He was working as a fry cook at his father's Pasadena, California sandwich shop, \"The Rite Spot\", and \"experimentally dropped a slab of American cheese on a sizzling hamburger.\"[2][3][4][5][6][7] An early example of the cheeseburger appearing on a menu is a 1928 menu for the Los Angeles restaurant O'Dell's which listed a cheeseburger smothered with chili for 25 cents.[8][9][10]\n\nOther restaurants also claim to have invented the cheeseburger. For example, Kaelin's Restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, said it invented the cheeseburger in 1934.[11] One year later, a trademark for the name \"cheeseburger\" was awarded to Louis Ballast of the Humpty Dumpty Drive-In in Denver, Colorado.[12] According to Steak 'n Shake archives, the restaurant's founder, Gus Belt, applied for a trademark on the word in the 1930s.[13][14][15]\n\nAn A&W Restaurants franchise in Lansing, Michigan is credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger in 1963, putting it on the menu after repeated requests from the same customer.[16]\n\nThe steamed cheeseburger, a variation almost exclusively served in central Connecticut, is believed to have been invented at a restaurant called Jack's Lunch in Middletown, Connecticut, in the 1930s.[17]\n\nThe largest cheeseburger ever made weighed 2,014 pounds (914 kg). It is said to have included \"60 pounds (27 kg) of bacon, 50 pounds (23 kg) of lettuce, 50 pounds (23 kg) of sliced onions, 40 pounds (18 kg) of pickles, and 40 pounds (18 kg) of cheese.\" This record was set in 2012 by Minnesota's Black Bear Casino, smashing the previous record of 881 pounds (400 kg).[18]\n\nIn the United States, National Cheeseburger Day is celebrated annually on September 18.[19]", "response": "The cheeseburger was invented after the late 19th century after the vast grasslands of the Great Plains opened up for cattle ranching.

The construction of the swap curve is described below.\n\nBesides the government curve and the LIBOR curve, there are corporate (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less creditworthiness than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher.

In general, calculus techniques mean to use objective and constraint information at a particular point x, to deduce information about the behaviour of the objective function at all surrounding points close to x. The deduced information is then used to guide the search direction. In contrast, combinatorial optimisation problems are to some extent harder to solve than continuous ones.

This choke point remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through it.[11][12][13] Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and bunkering.[14][15][16][17]\n\nThe sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations, as Spain asserts a claim to the territory.[15][18] Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum, and for shared sovereignty in a 2002 referendum. Nevertheless, Gibraltar maintains close economic and cultural links with Spain, with many Gibraltarians speaking Spanish as well as a local dialect known as Llanito.\n\nSince Brexit, Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union but negotiations are underway to have it participate in the Schengen Agreement to facilitate border movements between Gibraltar and Spain.[19] As of March 2023, talks seem deadlocked.[20]\n\nName\nThe name is derived from Arabic: \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642, romanized: Jabal \u1e6c\u0101riq, lit.\u2009'Mount of Tariq' (named after the 8th-century Moorish military leader Tariq ibn Ziyad).[21]", "response": "The name comes from the arabic meaning the mountain of Tarik", "catgr": "cloqa"}

Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.\n\nAll substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility.[1] Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field.

First, some perceived \"outages\" may actually be caused by overloading a circuit breaker in a home. To eliminate this as a possibility and confirm the issue is not localized to your home, check to make sure that all circuits in your electric panel are still on. \n\nIf you are experiencing a power outage, it may been caused by a few different reasons:\n- Power safety shutoff: in some situations, a power provider will de-electrify an area to prevent issues. This might be due to maintenance activities with employees working on a section of the power grid, or to prevent issues in inclimate weather, such as preventing wildfire ignition in high-wind events. \n- Weather-caused issues: high wind or ice-storms can sometimes snap power lines or cause tree limbs to fall. \n\nCheck with your utility provider to stay up to date on any outage you are experiencing. Most utilities provide SMS/text updates, which will keep you updated in case you lose access to the internet (as your home router requires power too!)", "catgr": "gqa"}

Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\n\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\n\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s. It's such a new finding, and it's totally changed the world. Science rules!", "catgr": "gqa"}

Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.[1] Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies.\n\nCoffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.\n\nBy 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999.[2] Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today.", "response": "* Oral tradition has coffee drinking originating in modern day Ethiopia\n* Sufi monasteries in Yemen used coffee to aid prayers in the 15th century\n* Spread to the Levant and Persia in the 16th century\n* Arrived in Italy in the second half of the 16th century via Ottoman empire\n* By mid-17th century had arrived in India and the East Indies\n* Established in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany\n* First cultivated in Martinique in the New World in 1720 and spread to Sanit-Domingue and Mexico\n* By 1852 Brazil had become the world's largest coffee producer\n* Since 1950 the major growers have been Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam", "catgr": "smzt"}

{"instr": "Based on the reference text, provide a summary of how the monthly benefit amount for social security is calculated.", "ctxt": "Primary Insurance Amount and Monthly Benefit Amount calculations\nMain article: Primary Insurance Amount\nWorkers in Social Security covered employment pay FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or SECA (Self Employed Contributions Act) taxes and earn quarters of coverage if earnings are above minimum amounts specified in the law. Workers with 40 quarters of coverage (QC) are \"fully insured\" and eligible for retirement benefits. Retirement benefit amounts depend upon the average of the person's highest 35 years of \"adjusted\" or \"indexed\" earnings. A person's payroll-taxable earnings from earlier years are adjusted for economy-wide wage growth, using the national average wage index (AWI), and then averaged.[31] If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings these non-contributory years are assigned zero earnings. The sum of the highest 35 years of adjusted or indexed earnings divided by 420 (35 years times 12 months per year) produces a person's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings or AIME.[31]\n\nThe AIME is then used to calculate the Primary Insurance Amount or PIA. For workers who turn 62 in 2021, the PIA computation formula is:\n\n(a) 90 percent of the first $996 of average indexed monthly earnings, plus\n\n(b) 32 percent of average indexed monthly earnings between $996 and $6,002, plus\n\n(c) 15 percent of average indexed monthly earnings over $6,002[32]\n\nFor workers who turn 62 in the future, the 90, 32, and 15 percent factors in the computation formula will remain the same but the dollar amounts in the formula (called bend points) will increase by wage growth in the national economy, as measured by the AWI. Because the AIME and the PIA calculation incorporate the AWI, Social Security benefits are said to be wage indexed. Because wages typically grow faster than prices, the PIAs for workers turning 62 in the future will tend to be higher in real terms but similar relative to average earnings in the economy at the time age 62 is attained.\n\nMonthly benefit amounts are based on the PIA. Once the PIA is computed, it is indexed for price inflation over time. Thus, Social Security monthly benefit amounts retain their purchasing power throughout a person's retirement years.\n\nA worker who first starts receiving a retirement benefit at the full retirement age receives a monthly benefit amount equal to 100 percent of the PIA. A worker who claims the retirement benefit before the full retirement age receives a reduced monthly benefit amount and a worker who claims at an age after the full retirement age (up to age 70) receives an increased monthly amount.[33]\n\nThe 90, 32, and 15 percent factors in the PIA computation lead to higher replacement rates for persons with lower career earnings. For example, a retired individual whose average earnings are below the first bend point can receive a monthly benefit at the full retirement age that equals 90 percent of the person's average monthly earnings before retirement. The table shows replacement rates for workers who turned 62 in 2013.\n\nThe PIA computation formula for disabled workers parallels that for retired workers except the AIME is based on fewer years to reflect disablement before age 62. The monthly benefit amount of a disabled worker is 100 percent of PIA.\n\nBenefits for spouses, children, and widow(er)s depend on the PIAs of a spouse or a deceased spouse. Aged spouse and divorced spouse beneficiaries can receive up to 50 percent of the PIA. Survivor benefit rates are higher and aged widow(er)s and aged surviving divorced spouses can receive 100 percent of the PIA.\n\nFederal, state and local employees who have elected (when they could) NOT to pay FICA taxes are eligible for a reduced FICA benefits and full Medicare coverage if they have more than forty quarters of qualifying Social Security covered work. To minimize the Social Security payments to those who have not contributed to FICA for 35+ years and are eligible for federal, state and local benefits, which are usually more generous, Congress passed the Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP.[36] The WEP provision will not eliminate all Social Security or Medicare eligibility if the worker has 40 quarters of qualifying income, but calculates the benefit payments by reducing the 90% multiplier in the first PIA bendpoint to 40\u201385% depending on the number of Years of Coverage.[37] Foreign pensions are subject to WEP.\n\nA special minimum benefit, based on an alternative PIA calculation, is available for some workers with long careers but low earnings. However, it is rarely higher than the regularly-computed PIA and thus few workers qualify for the special minimum benefit. Only 32,000 individuals received the special minimum benefit in 2019.[38]\n\nThe benefits someone is eligible for are potentially so complicated that potential retirees should consult the Social Security Administration directly for advice. Many questions are addressed and at least partially answered on many online publications and online calculators.", "response": "The monthly benefit amount for social security is calculated by determining an individual's highest 35 years of \"indexed\" earnings.

One lion king used to go everywhere in its kingdom with his advisors, the wolf and the fox. As lunch time approached, the king asked the wolf what we should do. The wolf said that the prey animals will be coming from the north. You wait hidden in the bush in the south. I shall wait in the west and the fox can wait in the east and ensure the prey do not escape to the east or west.\n \nGood idea. so they all followed the plan. Along came a rabbit, ran helter skelter frightened  on seeing the fox and the wolf and straight into the lion, who with one swipe of its paw killed the rabbit. Next a donkey came by and met a similar fate. So did a deer. The lion felt they had sufficient food for their meal and asked the wolf of how we were going to share the meal. The wolf said that the fox can have the rabbit., the lion can have the donkey and he would partake of the deer. The lion knew the tastiest meat is that of the deer, and sensing the deviousness of the advisor wolf smacked him dead. Next he asked the fox for advice on sharing. The fox meekly replied that whatever way the lion wants to have the meal is fine and good. On hearing this the lion said you are a wise and good advisor, who is your guru? The fox humbly replied that the wolf was his guru.  Seeing the fate of the wolf the fox learnt from the wolf's mistake.\n \nThe moral of the story: You can and must learn from your mistakes. To err is human. But to repeat a mistake is foolish. However we need not keep making mistakes to learn life lessons. It is really wise to learn from other's mistake.", "catgr": ""cwt"}

{"instr": "What are some disadvantages of the way the tax code treats incentive stock options?", "ctxt": "", "response": "There are three primary problems with the way the tax code treats incentive stock options. First, the tax code gives an employee a strong incentive to exercise the options early on, to achieve the tax benefit relating to the special option treatment. This means the tax code encourages young employees to write a check to their employer at a time when their entire financial life is likely to be dependent on that employer. This is the exact opposite of diversification, a key goal of personal financial management. The second issue is that the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is imposed at the time of exercise. This requires a potentially large cash outlay, at a time when the employee is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to meet the burden. So not only does the employee have to pay his or her employer to cover the exercise premium, he or she has to send funds to the Internal Revenue Service as well. Finally, the requirement that an employee terminating employment must exercise within three months of termination date to preserve the tax advantage of the options encourages exercise at a time when the employee may not have sufficient funds, and may be looking at financial uncertainty if he or she does not yet have a new job lined up. The advantages of incentive stock options are significant, but they encourage the wrong behavior.", "catgr": "gqa"}

{"instr": "Given this paragraph about modern triathlon, what year did the two founders form mission bay triathlon.", "ctxt": "The first modern swim/bike/run event was held at Mission Bay, San Diego, California on September 25, 1974.[14] The race was conceived and directed by two members of the San Diego Track Club, Jack Johnstone and Don Shanahan.[15] Johnstone recalls that he was a part of the 70s jogging craze in America and that after entering a few races he was not regaining his \"mediocre fitness\" despite having been a member of the 1957 Collegiate and AAU All-American swim teams.[16] Then in 1973, Johnstone learned of the Dave Pain Birthday Biathlon, a 7.2 km (4.5 mi) run followed by what was billed as a quarter-mile (0.4 km) swim (the actual distance was only between 200 and 300 yards). The following year, after competing in the event for the second time and placing in the top ten, Johnstone desired more of this style of race and with equal emphasis on the swim. So he petitioned the chairman of the San Diego Track Club who told him he would add a race to the club calendar. But the rest of the race was up to Johnstone to organise, and at the same time he was to contact Don Shanahan so there wouldn't be too many \"weird\" races on the club schedule. Shanahan told Johnstone that he wanted to include a biking leg to the race; whilst hesitant Johnstone agreed to the addition. When naming the event the pair used the unofficially agreed naming system for multisport events, already used for pentathlon, heptathlon, and decathlon. So they used the Greek prefix tri (three) for the number of events, followed by the already familiar athlon, hence naming the event the Mission Bay Triathlon.[17] It is worthy of note that neither founder had heard of the French events; both believed their race was a unique idea.[18]", "response": "Modern day triathlon is believed to have occurred in 1974 when founded by two members of the San Diego track club, Don Shanahan and Jack Johnstone. Although the pair reportedly founded the sport, it's important to understand not everything is created and owned by americans. The sport can be traced back to france in 1901, originally called \"Le Trois Sports\", which included Bike, Run and Canoe disciplines. Other forms of multisport had occurred before 1974 including biathlon which included a run of 7.2km followed by a swim of 0.4km) but Nonetheless, on the 25th September 1974, triathlon mission bay in San Diego, California was born.", "catgr": "cloqa"}
