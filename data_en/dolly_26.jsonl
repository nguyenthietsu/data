Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[2]\n\nThe title refers to the story's main antagonist,[b] the Dark Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Man Aragorn, the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.\n\nAlthough often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along with The Silmarillion.[3][T 3] For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes[3][4] titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material. Some later editions print the entire work in a single volume, following the author's original intent.\n\nTolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is considered one of the greatest fantasy books ever written and it has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages.[c] Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works,[5] and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games.\n\nAward-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film.

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).

Examples include \u2013 being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life.

Second, the public does not care about politics so they don't pay attention to campaign functions like speeches, candidate gaffes, or advertising.  Third, in presidential elections, each side has about the same amount of experts and money which cancels out any advantage those resources might bring.\nOther scholars argue that campaigns do matter, and they also have three main reasons for this.

Secondly, Gerber and Green argue that campaigns personalized outreach, such as, door-to-door or digital contact, will influence the person contacted to go and vote for the candidate.

City, area, zip: This is the primary decision that is made. It was also a function of the location that the underlying opportunity/job that triggers the relocation. In some cases, families might be returning. However, it is very important for one to research a city, area from multiple aspects before closing in or accepting the relocation. A right balance in terms of cons and pros can be ideal in selecting, since one may not find all requirements fulfilled in a particular location\n2. Cost of living/Inflation adjustment: Next is to test your selected area, zip, city with what you are going to earn from your primary business or job. Would you be able to maintain, if not improve your current standard of living. More importantly, with a family it is critical that you are also able to save a monthly sum towards health, education, etc for the future.\n3. Schooling: The education system across countries are very different. There are concepts of public, charter schools that exist in some locations, but they may be either not be par with quality you would expect or not exist at all. The education board options also make it complex, which requires one to make a choice based on their own preferences and ideology.  The third factor is the variation in teaching methodology, example Montessori.\n4. Healthcare: Identify primary health care providers soon, share medical records from the past and have the kids up to date on vaccination. There might be scenarios where one may have to re-vaccinate kids based on schooling requirement.\n4.

{"instr": "Why Do We Need GIS?", "ctxt": "", "response": "GIS use has become mandatory in many settings. GIS are used to fight crime, protect endangered species, reduce pollution, cope with natural disasters, treat epidemics, and improve public health; GIS are instrumental in addressing some of our most pressing societal problems.GIS tools in aggregate save billions of dollars annually in the delivery of goods and services. GIS regularly helps in the day-to-day management of many natural and man-made resources, including sewer, water,power, transportation networks, and package delivery. GIS are at the heart of one of the most important processes in U.S. democracy, decadal redrawing of U.S. congressional districts, and hence the distribution of tax dollars and other government resources.GIS are needed in part because human consumption has reached levels such that many resources, including air and land, replacing substantial limits on human action.The first 100,000 years of human existence caused scant impacts on the world's resources, but in the past 300 years humans have permanently altered most of the Earth's Surface. The atmosphere and oceans exhibit a decreasing ability to benignly absorb carbon dioxide and nitrogen, two of humanity's primary waste products. Silt chokes many rivers, and there are abundant examples of smoke, ozone, or other noxious pollutants substantially harming public health. By the end of the 20th century, most lands south of the boreal region had been farmed, grazed,cut, built over, drained, flooded, or otherwise altered by humans. GIS help us identify and address environmental problems by providing crucial information on where problems occur and who are affected by them. GIS helps us identify the source, location, and extent of adverse environmental impacts, and may help us devise practical plans for monitoring, managing, and mitigating environmental damage.Human impacts on the environment have spurred a strong societal push for the adoption of GIS. Conflicts in resource use,concerns about pollution, and precautions to protect public health have led to legislative mandates that explicitly or implicitly require the consideration of geography. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a good example. The ESA requires adequate protection of rare and threatened organisms. This entails mapping the available habitat and species range and migration patterns, relative to human land use. \nGIS use is mandated in other endeavors, including emergency services, flood protection, disaster assessment and management, and infrastructure development.Public organizations have also adopted GIS because it aids in governmental functions. For example, emergency service vehicles are regularly dispatched and route using GIS. E911 GIS matches the caller's address to the nearest emergency service station, a route is generated based on the streetnetwork and traffic, and emergency crews dispatched in a fraction of the pre-GIS times.Many businesses adopt GIS for increased efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. Retail businesses locate stores based on a number of spatially related factors. Where are the potential customers?What is the spatial distribution of competing businesses? Where are potential new store locations? What are traffic flows near current stores, and how easy is it to park near and access these stores? GIS are also used in hundreds of other business applications, toroute vehicles, guide advertising, design buildings, plan construction, and sell real estate.The societal push to adopt GIS has been complemented by a technological pull in the development and application of GIS. Thousands of lives and untold wealth have been lost because ship captains could not answer the simple question, \u201cWhere am I?\u201dRemarkable positioning technologies, generically known as Global Navigation SatelliteSystems (GNSS), are now indispensable tools in commerce, planning, and safety.The technological pull has developed on several fronts. Spatial analysis in particular has been helped by faster computers with more storage, and by the increased interconnectedness via mobile networks. Most real-world spatial problems were beyond the scope of all but the largest organization until the 1990s. GIS computing expenses are becoming an afterthought as costs decrease and performance increases at dizzying rates. Powerful field computers are lighter, faster,more capable, and less expensive, so spatial data display and analysis capabilities may always be at hand.In addition to the computing improvements and the development of GNSS, current \u201ccameras\u201d deliver amazingly detailed aerial and satellite images. Initially,advances in image collection and interpretation were spurred by World War II and then the Cold War because accurate maps were required, but unavailable.Turned toward peacetime endeavors, imaging technologies now help us map food and fodder, houses and highways, and most other natural and human-built objects. Images may be rapidly converted to accurate spatial information over broad areas. Many techniques have been developed for extracting information from image data, and also for ensuring this information faithfully represents the location, shape, and characteristics of features on the ground. Visible light,laser, thermal, and radar scanners are currently being developed to further increase the speed and accuracy with which we map our world. Thus, advances in these three key technologies \u2014 imaging, GNSS, and computing \u2014 have substantially aided the development of GIS.", "catgr": "gqa"}

{"instr": "As per the following passage what did William Gilbert do?", "ctxt": "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics.

{"instr": "In the following text, identify the key commanders and leaders of the Buddhist Uprising of 1966, extract their roles, and place them in a bulleted list.", "ctxt": "The Buddhist Uprising of 1966 (Vietnamese: N\u1ed5i d\u1eady Ph\u1eadt gi\u00e1o 1966), or more widely known in Vietnam as the Crisis in Central Vietnam (Vietnamese: Bi\u1ebfn \u0111\u1ed9ng Mi\u1ec1n Trung), was a period of civil and military unrest in South Vietnam, largely focused in the I Corps area in the north of the country in central Vietnam. The area is a heartland of Vietnamese Buddhism, and at the time, activist Buddhist monks and civilians were at the forefront of opposition to a series of military juntas that had been ruling the nation, as well as prominently questioning the escalation of the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring the rule of the Catholic Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the discrimination against the majority Buddhist population generated the growth of Buddhist institutions as they sought to participate in national politics and gain better treatment. In 1965, after a series of military coups that followed the fall of the Di\u1ec7m regime in 1963, Air Marshal Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 and General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u finally established a stable junta, holding the positions of Prime Minister and figurehead Chief of State respectively. The K\u1ef3-Thi\u1ec7u regime was initially almost a feudal system, being more of an alliance of warlords than a state as each corps commander ruled his area as his own fiefdom, handing some of the taxes they collected over to the government in Saigon and keeping the rest for themselves. During that time, suspicion and tension continued between the Buddhist and Catholic factions in Vietnamese society.\n\nThe religious factor combined with a power struggle between K\u1ef3 and General Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00e1nh Thi, the commander of I Corps, a Buddhist local to the region and popular in the area. Thi was a strong-willed officer regarded as a capable commander, and K\u1ef3 saw him as a threat, as did others within the junta. In February 1966, K\u1ef3 attended a summit in Honolulu, where he became convinced that he now had American support to move against Thi, the strongest and most able of the corps commanders. In March 1966, K\u1ef3 fired Thi and ordered him into exile in the United States under the false pretense of medical treatment. This prompted both civilians and some I Corps units to launch widespread civil protests against K\u1ef3's regime and halt military operations against Viet Cong. K\u1ef3 gambled by allowing Thi to return to I Corps before departing for the US, but the arrival of the general to his native area only fuelled anti-K\u1ef3 sentiment. The Buddhist activists, students and Thi loyalists in the military coalesced into the \"Struggle Movement\", calling for a return to civilian rule and elections. Meanwhile, Thi stayed in I Corps and did not leave; strikes and protests stopped civilian activity in the area, government radio stations were taken over and used for anti-K\u1ef3 campaigning, and military operations ceased. Riots also spread to the capital Saigon and other cities further south.\n\nAt the start of April, K\u1ef3 decided to move. He declared that Da Nang, the main centre in I Corps, was under communist control and publicly vowed to kill the mayor, who had expressed support for the Struggle Movement. K\u1ef3 moved military forces into the city and travelled there to prepare for an assault, but had to withdraw and then start discussions with Buddhist leaders, as it was obvious that he was not strong enough to crush the opposition. In the meantime, he fired Thi's successor Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Chu\u00e2n because he wanted a firmer attempt to regain control, and appointed T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh to replace him. \u0110\u00ednh claimed to have calmed the situation, but K\u1ef3 viewed the situation as appeasement, and on May 15, his forces drove off \u0110\u00ednh and took over. During the previous month, American forces had also become involved in the stand-off, and the Struggle Movement viewed their participation as biased towards K\u1ef3, leading to some tense confrontations.\n\nIn the second half of May, K\u1ef3's forces began to force the issue and gradually wore down the Struggle Movement as the rebel I Corps forces were worn down, despite some American objections that his aggressive attacks had the potential to cause too much collateral damage. At one stage, K\u1ef3's forces ended up in a skirmish with American forces, and later, the Americans were in the middle of a stand-off between the Vietnamese factions regarding a mined bridge. As K\u1ef3's forces took back Da Nang and Hu\u1ebf in street fighting, Struggle Movement supporters saw American intervention as being pro-K\u1ef3, and anti-US riots resulted in some American buildings being burnt down. K\u1ef3's triumph ended the Buddhist movement's influence on politics and he confined their leader Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang to house arrest thereafter, while Thi left for the United States.", "response": "-- Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3: Air Marshal of South Vietnam leading up to the Buddhist Uprising of 1966.

In that case, you must obtain a permit from the Backcountry Information Center. Camping sites are limited in the Grand Canyon, and spots are issued four months before a given month. E.g., For January, permit applications should be submitted between Aug 20 and Sep 1 to be considered \"earliest requested.\"\nFor requests received during the Earliest Consideration period, the day received does not matter; all Earliest Consideration requests received during this span of dates are treated the same. It may take Rangers up to three weeks to process all Earliest Consideration requests.\nSubsequent Requests: Once all Earliest Consideration requests are processed, Rangers will begin processing written requests received on subsequent dates. These Subsequent Requests are kept and considered in the order received. Submissions will be accepted as late as two weeks before a hike start date.\n \nIf your permit request is selected, you must diligently plan your trip. You will need to carry everything you need for the duration of your journey with you except for water which is few and far between. Know where the water sources are on your route and carry filtration devices, water purification equipment, and backup equipment. The hotter the trip, the more water you will require. Have a plan for where the necessary water will be on your route, and double-check with the park service ahead of time that water is still there. Dehydration is the number one reason for rescue and death in the canyon. Some springs dry up in the summer months.\n \nTravel as light as possible; you must pack everything you bring into the canyon, including used toilet paper.    Plan each meal, knowing how much calories and water you consume based on your planned exertion level. Calorie and water requirements also change based on temperature (the hotter the day, the more water and food you will need). Also, make sure you have the appropriate gear based on temperatures. It is approximately 20 degrees cooler at the top of the canyon than at the bottom because there is a 5000 feet vertical difference at the South Rim and 6000 at the North Rim. Ensure your footwear is \"broken in\", and carry first-aid kits with particular attention to foot care, such as blister pads and moleskin.   \n \nStart with shorter, more leisurely trips; if you like them, move up to more adventurous multi-day trips. Plan on rest days when you can enjoy the majestic scenery of one of the world's natural wonders.

{"instr": "Summarise Bernoulli's principle based on the following paragraphs.", "ctxt": "Bernoulli's principle is a key concept in fluid dynamics that relates pressure, speed and height. Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.\u200a The principle is named after the Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli, who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738.Although Bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases, it was Leonhard Euler in 1752 who derived Bernoulli's equation in its usual form. The principle is only applicable for isentropic flows: when the effects of irreversible processes (like turbulence) and non-adiabatic processes (e.g. thermal radiation) are small and can be neglected.\nBernoulli's principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid is the same at all points that are free of viscous forces. This requires that the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy and internal energy remains constant. Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid\u2014implying an increase in its kinetic energy (dynamic pressure)\u2014occurs with a simultaneous decrease in (the sum of) its potential energy (including the static pressure) and internal energy. If the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir, the sum of all forms of energy is the same because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume (the sum of pressure and gravitational potential \u03c1\u2009g\u2009h) is the same everywhere.\nBernoulli's principle can also be derived directly from Isaac Newton's second Law of Motion. If a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, then there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline.\nFluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.", "response": "Bernoulli's principle is a key concept in fluid dynamics that relates pressure, speed and height.

(/\u02cclu\u02d0lu\u02c8l\u025bm\u0259n/; styled in all lowercase[2]) is a Canadian multinational athletic apparel retailer headquartered in British Columbia and incorporated in Delaware, United States.[3] It was founded in 1998 as a retailer of yoga pants and other yoga wear, and has expanded to also sell athletic wear, lifestyle apparel, accessories, and personal care products. The company has 574 stores internationally, and also sells online.\n\nHistory\nLululemon was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, with its first standalone store opening in November 2000.[4][5] Wilson created the name to have many L's so that it would sound western to Japanese buyers, who often have difficulty pronouncing the letter. He later remarked that he found it \"funny to watch [Japanese speakers] try and say it\" and that \"it was the only reason behind the name\".[6]\n\nThe company's initial public offering was in July 2007, raising $327.6 million by selling 18.2 million shares.[7][8] Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks, became chief executive officer in 2008.[7]\n\nIn 2013, the company made its third consecutive appearance on Fortune's Fastest-Growing Companies list.[7] In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that the president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.[9]\n\nIn 2014, Lululemon opened its first store in Europe, a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London.[10] In February 2015, Wilson announced that he was resigning from the board,[11][12] and that Michael Casey, former lead director of the board, would replace him.[13] In 2018, Laurent Potdevin resigned as CEO and from the company's board due to misconduct.[14][15]\n\nFrom its founding through 2015, Lululemon incorporated elements of Landmark Forum into its leadership and development training.[16] According to a company source, seventy per cent of managers are hired internally.[17] Store managers are responsible for their store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.[17]\n\nIn 2019, Lululemon announced an investment in MIRROR, a fitness startup that sells an interactive mirror with a camera and speakers for at-home workouts. The companies planned to create new content for the device, starting with meditation classes.[18] In June 2020, Lululemon announced a $500 million deal to purchase MIRROR, capitalizing on a growing trend of people conducting virtual workouts at home instead of going to a gym due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[19] The company eventually took a post-tax impairment charge of $442.7 million related to the acquisition at the end of fiscal 2022.[20]\n\nProducts\nLululemon sells athletic wear including tops, yoga pants \u2013 a product that the company invented,[21][22] shorts, sweaters, jackets and undergarments,[5] as well as hair accessories, bags, yoga mats, water bottles, and personal care products such as deodorant and dry shampoo.[23] Lululemon trademarked its original fabric, Luon, which included a higher-than-average amount of nylon microfiber, in 2005.[5] Since then, the company has produced several different types of fabrics, including compression and moisture-wicking designs.[5] Lululemon is primarily known for their leggings, which first made the brand popular.\n\nLululemon maintains a research and development lab, \"Whitespace,\" within its headquarters. It has around 50 employees including scientists and physiologists.[5][24]\n\nIn 2019, the company launched a luxury streetwear brand called Lab in a few of its stores.[25] In the same year, the company announced plans to double its men's business in the next five years beyond its women's and accessory business, competing against other athletic wear such as Nike and Under Armour.[26]\n\nMarketing\nTwo Lululemon stores with their products in exhibition, (left) Promenade; (right): Hong Kong\nOriginally known for women's yoga apparel, by 2019 Lululemon had grown by acquiring more male customers and adapting its product and marketing strategies accordingly; it plans to increase awareness of its brand among men.[27] The company has been stated to use \"holistic guerrilla marketing\", aiming to make customers feel that by wearing Lululemon clothing they are part of a larger community.[28] It uses social media including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as a main method of marketing the company and its products. Lululemon offers fitness instructors 25 percent off their orders.[29]\n\nControversies\nIn November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that the clothing, made from seaweed, provided \"anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits\"[30] but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between ordinary T-shirt cotton and Vitasea fabric.[30] Lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.[31]\n\nIn 2013, some customers complained that the clothing was of poor quality, with some items being \"too sheer\", having holes appear, and falling apart after a few uses.[32][33] In December 2010, Lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead.[34] In 2013, Lululemon recalled its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and \"too thin\";[35][36] the recall, which amounted to approximately 17 percent of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results.[37] The resulting financial loss and damage to the brand led to the forced departure of the company's Chief product officer, Sheree Waterson,[38][7] and of its CEO, Christine Day.[7][39]\n\nFounder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. In a 2004 interview, Wilson mocked Japanese pronunciation of the company's name.[40] In 2013 he said that the company did not make clothes for plus-size women because it was too costly.[41] In an effort to explain away excessive pilling in the brand's clothing, he blamed some customers for wearing Lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes.[42] In an interview for Bloomberg TV in 2013, he stated that some women's bodies were unsuitable for the brand's clothing.[42] Time called the remarks \"fat shaming\".[43] Comments such as these reportedly led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.[44] In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders stating that the company had \"lost its way\" and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings.[45][46] Since then, Wilson has used his website \"Elevate Lululemon\" to criticize the brand and business.[47][48]\n\nIn 2012, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three of its design patents for yoga pants.[49] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert intellectual property protection in clothing through patent rights. The case was settled out of court the same year.[50]\n\nIn 2021, a Business Insider report revealed that an unnamed company director pushed employees to create an All Lives Matter campaign to be displayed on its website in response to the murder of George Floyd. Employees pushed back but were told to move forward and create a mock up with the All Lives Matter copy, however they also created a Black Lives Matter artwork mock up that in the end was selected instead. The director apologized to 200 members of the company over conference call and subsequently left the company.[51][52]\n\nIn September 2022, 1,698 yoga teachers and students via advocacy groups Stand.earth and Actions Speaks Louder wrote to the company demanding a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. They claimed that roughly half of the firm's energy came from coal production.[53]", "response": "- False claims about one of their products in 2007\n- Poor quality complains about clothing material in 2013\n- Ex-CEO's controversial statements in numerous occasions between 2004 and 2016\n- Lawsuit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group on patent rights in 2012\n- An internal dispute over an All Lives Matter campaign pushed by an unnamed director who later apologized and left the company\n- A public demand of the company to transition to renewable energy from coal energy from a group of yoga teachers and students in 2022", "catgr": "smzt"}

It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest. African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008\u20132009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7, although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation.

{"instr": "Using this definition, can you summarize why hyperventilation is considered dangerous?", "ctxt": "Voluntary hyperventilation before beginning voluntary apnea is commonly believed to allow the person involved to safely hold their breath for a longer period. In reality, it will give the impression that one does not need to breathe, while the body is actually experiencing a blood-oxygen level that would normally, and indirectly, invoke a strong dyspnea and eventually involuntary breathing. Some have incorrectly attributed the effect of hyperventilation to increased oxygen in the blood, not realizing that it is actually due to a decrease in CO2 in the blood and lungs. Blood leaving the lungs is normally fully saturated with oxygen, so hyperventilation of normal air cannot increase the amount of oxygen available, as oxygen in blood is the direct factor. Lowering the CO2 concentration increases the pH of the blood, thus increasing the time before blood becomes acidic enough so the respiratory center becomes stimulated, as described above. \nThe primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized and it needs to be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allowing the delay of breathing and leaving the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people, the first sign of low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.\nIf a person loses consciousness underwater, there is considerable danger that they will drown. An alert diving partner or nearby lifeguard would be in the best position to rescue such a person. Static apnea blackout occurs at the surface when a motionless diver holds their breath long enough for the circulating oxygen in blood to fall below that required for the brain to maintain consciousness. It involves no pressure changes in the body and is usually performed to enhance breath-hold time. It should never be practiced alone, but under strict safety protocols with a safety guard or equipment beside the diver.", "response": "Hyperventilation does not increase the amount of oxygen available but artificially decreases carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in blood and lungs. \nBecause the primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide levels, it gives false impression that one does not need to breath. This can lead to sudden lost of consciousness. If this happens underwater, there is a considerable risk of drowning. \nThis is why hyperventilation is considered as dangerous and should be avoided.", "catgr": "smzt"}
{"instr": "Based on the text provided, what does a minimum spanning tree optimize?", "ctxt": "A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.\n\nThere are many use cases for minimum spanning trees. One example is a telecommunications company trying to lay cable in a new neighborhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths (e.g. roads), then there would be a graph containing the points (e.g. houses) connected by those paths. Some of the paths might be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights. Currency is an acceptable unit for edge weight \u2013 there is no requirement for edge lengths to obey normal rules of geometry such as the triangle inequality. A spanning tree for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects every house; there might be several spanning trees possible.

First, it is a first-person shooter (FPS) which allows you to select from a wide range of available characters or heroes. Each of these heroes provides their own set of unique abilities meaning you can always pick a new hero and play the game in a different way. Second, it is a team-based game, so every match you play will be different. There are many different strategies you can implement and they depend on the heroes that you and your team along with whatever composition the opponents have selected. Third and finally, the creators of Overwatch, Blizzard, released a new version of the game: Overwatch 2. This has introduced new heroes, maps, and a new competition mode which has made the game fun for existing and new players.", "catgr": "gqa"}

In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu.[12] The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[13] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[14][15]", "response": "The English term \"Japan\" dates back to a 16th century English translation of a Portuguese book which named the country using an old Malaysian name borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect.

{"instr": "Given the following summary of the book \"Human Compatible\" by Stuart Russell, what is the author's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI?", "ctxt": "Russell begins by asserting that the standard model of AI research, in which the primary definition of success is getting better and better at achieving rigid human-specified goals, is dangerously misguided. Such goals may not actually reflect what human designers intend, such as by failing to take into account any human values not included in the goals. If an AI developed according to the standard model were to become superintelligent, it would likely not fully reflect human values and could be catastrophic to humanity. Russell asserts that precisely because the timeline for developing human-level or superintelligent AI is highly uncertain, safety research should be begun as soon as possible, as it is also highly uncertain how long it would take to complete such research.\n\nRussell argues that continuing progress in AI capability is inevitable because of economic pressures. Such pressures can already be seen in the development of existing AI technologies such as self-driving cars and personal assistant software. Moreover, human-level AI could be worth many trillions of dollars. Russell then examines the current debate surrounding AI risk. He offers refutations to a number of common arguments dismissing AI risk and attributes much of their persistence to tribalism\u2014AI researchers may see AI risk concerns as an \"attack\" on their field. Russell reiterates that there are legitimate reasons to take AI risk concerns seriously and that economic pressures make continued innovation in AI inevitable.\n\nRussell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focuses on deference to humans. Unlike in the standard model of AI, where the objective is rigid and certain, this approach would have the AI's true objective remain uncertain, with the AI only approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world. This uncertainty would, ideally, prevent catastrophic misunderstandings of human preferences and encourage cooperation and communication with humans. Russell concludes by calling for tighter governance of AI research and development as well as cultural introspection about the appropriate amount of autonomy to retain in an AI-dominated world.", "response": "Russell suggests that the AIs should be trained in a way that makes them gradually gain knowledge of what is truly beneficial to humans.

{"instr": "Please give a brief history of AI.", "ctxt": "The Dartmouth Workshop of 1956 was organized by Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and two senior scientists: Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. The proposal for the conference included this assertion: \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".The participants included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research. At the workshop Newell and Simon debuted the \"Logic Theorist\" and McCarthy persuaded the attendees to accept \"Artificial Intelligence\" as the name of the field. The 1956 Dartmouth workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first success and its major players, and is widely considered the birth of AI. The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was chosen by McCarthy to avoid associations with cybernetics and connections with the influential cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.\n\nThe programs developed in the years after the Dartmouth Workshop were, to most people, simply \"astonishing\" computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such \"intelligent\" behavior by machines was possible at all. Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years. Government agencies like DARPA poured money into the new field.\n\nIn the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons. Despite the difficulties with public perception of AI in the late 70s, new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas.\n\nIn the 1980s a form of AI program called \"expert systems\" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. In those same years, the Japanese government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer project. Another encouraging event in the early 1980s was the revival of connectionism in the work of John Hopfield and David Rumelhart. Once again, AI had achieved success.\n\nThe business community's fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. The collapse was due to the failure of commercial vendors to develop a wide variety of workable solutions. As dozens of companies failed, the perception was that the technology was not viable. However, the field continued to make advances despite the criticism. Numerous researchers, including robotics developers Rodney Brooks and Hans Moravec, argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe field of AI, now more than a half a century old, finally achieved some of its oldest goals. It began to be used successfully throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. Some of the success was due to increasing computer power and some was achieved by focusing on specific isolated problems and pursuing them with the highest standards of scientific accountability. Still, the reputation of AI, in the business world at least, was less than pristine. Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of \"artificial intelligence\". AI was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been.\n\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as \"big data\"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. In fact, McKinsey Global Institute estimated in their famous paper \"Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity\" that \"by 2009, nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data\".\n\nBy 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than 8 billion dollars, and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a \"frenzy\". The applications of big data began to reach into other fields as well, such as training models in ecology and for various applications in economics.

Charlestown was laid out in 1629 by engineer Thomas Graves, one of its earliest settlers, during the reign of Charles I of England. It was originally a separate town and the first capital of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nCharlestown became a city in 1848 and was annexed by Boston on January 5, 1874. With that, it also switched from Middlesex County, to which it had belonged since 1643, to Suffolk County. It has had a substantial Irish-American population since the migration of Irish people during the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s. Since the late 1980s, the neighborhood has changed dramatically because of its proximity to downtown and its colonial architecture. A mix of yuppie and upper-middle-class gentrification has influenced much of the area, as it has in many of Boston's neighborhoods, but Charlestown still maintains a strong Irish-American population.\n\nIn the 21st century, Charlestown's diversity has expanded dramatically, along with growing rates of the very poor and very wealthy. Today Charlestown is a largely residential neighborhood, with much housing near the waterfront, overlooking the Boston skyline. Charlestown is home to many historic sites, hospitals and organizations, with access from the Orange Line Sullivan Square or Community College stops or the I-93 expressway.", "response": "Charlestown, Massachusetts", "catgr": "cloqa"}

This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.[62][63][64]\n\nThey probably first met personally in November 1881,[note 1] though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later.[62] At this time, Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture.[66] According to Makarand Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.[67]\n\nIn late 1881 or early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna.[62] This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life.[68] Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and began to frequently visit him at Dakshineswar.[69] He initially saw Ramakrishna's ecstasies and visions as \"mere figments of imagination\"[27] and \"hallucinations\".[70] As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism and Ramakrishna's worship of Kali.[71] He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta of \"identity with the absolute\" as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea.[70] Narendra tested Ramakrishna, who faced his arguments patiently: \"Try to see the truth from all angles\", he replied.[69]\n\nNarendra's father's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once a son of a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college.[72] He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence,[73] but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.[74]\n\nOne day, Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna instead suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess.[75][76][77] Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.[69]\n\nIn 1885, Ramakrishna developed throat cancer, and was transferred to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi.[78] Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order.[79] He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God.[27][78] Ramakrishna asked him to care of the other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader.[80] Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.", "response": "In 1881, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa asked Swami Vivekananda to come to Dakshineswar", "catgr": "cloqa"}

Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant care and attention. The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a creamy texture. \n The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed, the heat is raised to medium-high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring constantly. The constant stirring, with only a small amount of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of grated parmesan cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.\nProperly cooked risotto is rich and creamy even if no cream is added due to the starch in the grains. It has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda (\"wavy\" or \"flowing in waves\"). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter.

The name Goldendoodle is derived from \"Golden\" (from Golden Retriever) and \"Labradoodle\" (itself a portmanteau of Labrador Retriever and a Poodle).[3][4] Deliberately breeding Poodles with Golden Retrievers actually preceded the 1990s. An example of this was done by Monica Dickens, the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, who crossed the two breeds in 1969.[5] The cross can result in a healthier animal than both parent breeds.[6][1][7]\n\nThe first litter of Mini Goldendoodles was created by Amy Lane of Fox Creek Farm in Berkeley Springs, WV. The litter arrived on 1/11/02 and consisted of 10 puppies.[citation needed] Two of these puppies were retained for future breeding and one of them produced the first litter of F1B Mini Goldendoodles.

This is a non-profit organization that guides the development of the Goldendoodle and also provides a registration service to document the lineage of Goldendoodles.[citation needed]\n\nThe original aim of the Goldendoodle's breeders was to produce an alternative to the popular Labradoodle.[3] Initially Goldendoodles were only bred from standard-sized Poodles, but designer breeders also started using small varieties of Poodles to create a smaller crossbreed.[2] As they are a hybrid cross, they are not recognized by the AKC or British Kennel Clubs.

{"instr": "What is carnitine?", "ctxt": "", "response": "Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria. In support of energy metabolism, carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria to be oxidized for free energy production, and also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. Generally individuals, including strict vegetarians, synthesize enough L-carnitine in vivo.\n\nCarnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers d-carnitine (S-(+)-) and l-carnitine (R-(\u2212)-)).[5] Both are biologically active, but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form.[6] At room temperature, pure carnitine is a whiteish powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with relatively low toxicity. Derived from amino acids,[7] carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, \"caro/carnis\" or flesh.\n\nSome individuals with genetic or medical disorders (such as preterm infants) cannot make enough carnitine, requiring dietary supplementation. Despite common carnitine supplement consumption among athletes for improved exercise performance or recovery, there is insufficient high-quality clinical evidence to indicate it provides any benefit.", "catgr": "opqa"}

{"instr": "What is an allele?", "ctxt": "", "response": "An allele is a variation of the same sequence of nucleotides at the same place on a long DNA molecule, as described in leading textbooks on genetics and evolution.\n\nThe word \"Allele\" is a short form of \"allelomorph\".\n\n\"The chromosomal or genomic location of a gene or any other genetic element is called a locus (plural: loci) and alternative DNA sequences at a locus are called alleles.\"\n\nThe simplest alleles are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), but they can also be insertions and deletions of up to several thousand base pairs.\n\nPopular definitions of 'allele' typically refer only to different alleles within genes. For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.\n\nMost alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nNearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene.", "catgr": "opqa"}

{"instr": "What is the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins?", "ctxt": "", "response": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins, and also nucleic acids, and their complexes. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt W\u00fcthrich at the ETH,[1] and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH,[2] and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated.\n\nNMR involves the quantum-mechanical properties of the central core (\"nucleus\") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.\n\nCurrently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.\n\nA typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (\"chemical biology\") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a \"model\" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals.", "catgr": "opqa"}

Federer won four ITF junior singles tournaments in his career, including the prestigious Orange Bowl, where he defeated Guillermo Coria in the final.[30] By the end of 1998 he attained the No. 1 junior world ranking and was awarded ITF junior World Champion.[31] He ended his junior career at the end of 1998 with a high-ranking of No. 1 in singles and No. 7 in doubles (both attained on December 31, 1998) and a win\u2013loss record of 78\u201320 in singles and 36\u201321 in doubles.[32]\n\nJunior Grand Slam results \u2013 Singles:\n\nAustralian Open: SF (1998)\nFrench Open: 1R (1998)\nWimbledon: W (1998)\nUS Open: F (1998)\n\nJunior Grand Slam results \u2013 Doubles:\n\nAustralian Open: SF (1998)\nFrench Open: 1R (1998)\nWimbledon: W (1998)\nUS Open: 1R (1998)\n\n1998\u20132002: Early professional career\nMain article: Roger Federer's early career\nFederer made his ATP debut at the 1998 Swiss Open Gstaad in his home country of Switzerland losing to Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round. Later that year, he won his first ATP match in Toulouse against Guillaume Raoux. He got a wildcard into the 1998 Swiss Indoors and lost in the first round to 4th seed and former world number 1 Andre Agassi. Federer finished his career as a 10-time champion of the tournament.\n\nFederer entered the top 100 ranking for the first time on 20 September 1999 and started at the 1999 Marseille Open defeating the reigning champion of the 1998 French Open, Spaniard Carlos Moy\u00e1. His first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset.[33] Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with world No. 1 Martina Hingis.[34][35][36] The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer later said that his experience with Hingis \"definitely helped me to become the player I am today.\"[37]\n\nFederer's first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final.[33][38] Although he won his first title already in 1999 on the Challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain with Dutchman Sander Groen, the final was played on Federer's 18th birthday. In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, losing to former world No. 2 and eventual finalist \u00c0lex Corretja. His run to the French quarterfinals launched him into the top 15 for the first time in his career.[39][40]\n\nHis international breakthrough came at the 2001 Wimbledon Championships, when the 19-year-old Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras. Federer beat the No. 1 seed in a five-set match to reach the quarterfinals.[41] In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in a fourth-set tiebreaker.[42]\n\nThe first final he reached at the Masters level came at the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to former and future No. 1 Andre Agassi on hard court.[43][44] Federer won his first Master Series event at the 2002 Hamburg Masters on clay, over Marat Safin; the victory put him in the top 10 for the first time.[43][45] Federer made 10 singles finals between 1998 and 2002, of which he won four and lost six.[33][43][46][47][39] He also made six finals in doubles.

However, he fell in the semifinals to Roddick, in a final-set tiebreaker, leaving him 120 points behind Agassi.[50] This, coupled with early losses to David Nalbandian at Cincinnati and the US Open, denied Federer the chance to become No. 1 for the duration of the season.[51]\n\nFederer won his first and only doubles Masters event in Miami with Max Mirnyi[52] and made it to one singles Masters event in Rome on clay, which he lost.[53][54] Federer made it to nine finals on the ATP Tour and won seven of them, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna.[53] Lastly, Federer won the year-end championships over Andre Agassi, finishing the year as world No. 2, narrowly behind Andy Roddick by only 160 points.[53][55]\n\n2004: Imposing dominance\nMain article: 2004 Roger Federer tennis season\nDuring 2004 Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and became the first person to do in one season so since Mats Wilander in 1988. His first major hard-court title came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin, making him the world No. 1 for the first time.[56] He then won his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick.[57] At the US Open, Federer defeated the 2001 champion, Lleyton Hewitt, for his first title there.[58]\n\nFederer won three ATP Masters events, one on clay in Hamburg, and the other two on hard surfaces at Indian Wells and in Canada.[58] Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai and wrapped up the year by winning the year-end championships for the second time.[58] He also won his first tournament on home soil by capturing the Swiss Open in Gstaad. His 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 74\u20136 was the best since Ivan Lendl in 1986.[59] He reached the year-end No. 1 ranking for the first time.[60]\n\n2005: Consolidating dominance\nMain article: 2005 Roger Federer tennis season\nIn 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal.[61] However, Federer reestablished his dominance on grass, winning Wimbledon for a third time by defeating Andy Roddick.[62] At the US Open, Federer defeated Andre Agassi in the latter's last major final.[63][64]\n\nFederer also took four Masters wins: Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay.[63] The win in Miami was particularly noteworthy as it was the first final contested between Federer and Nadal. Federer recovered from two sets and a break down to take the final in five sets. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai.[63] Federer lost the year-end championships to David Nalbandian in five sets while playing through a foot injury that sidelined him for almost the rest of the season after September.[65] He maintained his position as No. 1 for the entire season.[63]\n\nFederer won 11 singles titles, which ties his 2004 season. Federer's 81 match victories were the most since Pete Sampras in 1993, and his record of 81\u20134 (95.2%) remains the third-best winning percentage in the Open Era behind John McEnroe's 1984 and Jimmy Connors's 1974.[59]\n\n2006: Career-best season\nMain article: 2006 Roger Federer tennis season\nThe 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969.[66]\n\n\nFederer hits a forehand at the 2006 US Open, where he became the first man in history to achieve the Wimbledon-US Open double for three consecutive seasons.\nFederer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since Thomas Muster in 1995 and John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92\u20135 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.[67]\n\nIn 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open.[67] This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis,[68] and at the US Open, Federer defeated 2003 champion Roddick.[67] In addition, Federer reached six Masters finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.[69]\n\nFederer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1.[68] Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters, in what was Federer's only defeat before the final of a tournament that year.[70] Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.[71]\n\nNear the end of the season he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runner up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.[72]\n\n2007: Holding off young rivals\nMain article: 2007 Roger Federer tennis season\nIn 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the Australian Open without dropping a set, beating Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez in the final. This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as Bj\u00f6rn Borg at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set.[73] Federer had entered the year on a huge winning streak and after capturing his fourth Dubai crown Federer's winning streak stood at 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the record. Federer entered Indian Wells as the three-time defending champion, but his streak ended in controversy. He was defeated by an Argentine, Guillermo Ca\u00f1as, who had failed a drug test for illegal doping.[74]\n\n\nFederer was called \"Darth Federer\" by fans and commentators at the 2007 US Open.\nThis surprising first-round loss marked the first time he was defeated since August 2006, a period spanning over 7 months.[75]\n\nDuring the clay season Federer's victory in the Hamburg Masters final was particularly impressive, as it snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel.[76] At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a repeat of the previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.[77]\n\nAt Wimbledon Federer entered the tournament not only as the four-time defending champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak on grass. Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a thrilling five-set encounter that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since 1980. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with Bj\u00f6rn Borg for the record of five consecutive championships at the All England Club.[78]\n\nFederer reached the final in Montreal before playing a young and relatively unknown Serbian named Novak Djokovic. Djokovic proved his potential by beating the world No. 1 in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year. Federer entered the US Open as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final. This time, Federer prevailed in a close straight-set match.[79] Victory in New York moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of major championship victories. Throughout the tournament the American press nicknamed him Darth Federer for his all-black attire (which included tuxedo-striped shorts) and the tournament played \"The Imperial March\" from Star Wars when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches.[80] He closed out the year with victories in Basel and the year-end championships in Shanghai.[81]\n\nHe finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and during these four years he won 11 Grand Slam singles titles. After his phenomenal triple Grand Slam season yet again, Federer became the only player in history to win three majors in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007).[82][83][84][85] It was the third consecutive season that Federer held the No. 1 ranking for all 52 weeks of the year.[60]\n\n2008: Illness, Olympic Gold, and fifth US Open\nMain article: 2008 Roger Federer tennis season\nFederer's success in 2008 was severely hampered by a lingering bout of mononucleosis, which he suffered during the first half of the year.[86] At the end of the year he suffered a back injury.[87]\n\nIn 2008, Federer captured one Grand Slam, a singles title at the US Open over Andy Murray.[88] Federer was defeated by Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, the French Open and Wimbledon, which was regarded as the best match of tennis history by many, when he was going for six straight wins to break Bj\u00f6rn Borg's record. He came back from two sets down to force a fifth set, where he fell just two points from the title.[88] At the Australian Open Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals.[88] He lost twice in Masters finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg.[88] Federer captured three titles playing in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.[89][90][91]\n\nAt the Olympic Games Federer and Stan Wawrinka won the gold medal in doubles, after beating the Bryan brothers American team in the semifinals and the Swedish duo of Simon Aspelin and Thomas Johansson in the final.[92] However, Federer could reach only the quarterfinals in the singles draw, bowing out to then No. 8 James Blake, ceding his No. 1 ranking to Nadal after being at the top for a record 237 consecutive weeks.[93] He ended the year ranked No. 2.\n\nFederer entered the 2009 season with 13 Grand Slams, only one behind Pete Sampras' all-time record. The season began with a loss to Nadal in the final of the Australian Open in a hotly contested five-set match.[95] Federer struggled following the defeat in Melbourne and entered the clay season without a title.[96]\n\n\nFederer winning the 2009 French Open, and completing the career Grand Slam\nFederer's season turned around in the final Masters event of the clay season when he defeated Nadal on clay for only the second time to capture the Madrid Masters.[97] Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin S\u00f6derling, Federer became the overwhelming favorite. In his next match, he came from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets.[98] He also fought back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro to win a five setter in the semifinals.[99] In the final, he faced S\u00f6derling, and with straight sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam.[100] This victory also tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.[101][100]\n\nFederer turned his sights to the grass courts of Wimbledon, where he breezed his way up to the final.[102] In the championship match he faced long-time rival Andy Roddick in what was their eighth and final meeting at a Grand Slam. Roddick pushed Federer into a record-setting fifth set, which Federer claimed 16\u201314 to win his 15th Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of Pete Sampras.[103][104]\n\nFederer continued his summer run by winning his third title on the lightning-fast courts of the Cincinnati Masters, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[105] At the US Open he defeated S\u00f6derling in the quarters and Djokovic, for the third consecutive year, in the semifinals. On the penultimate point of the Djokovic match he hit what many consider to be the greatest shot of his career, a tweener winner, to set up match points.[106] Federer was defeated by del Potro in the final despite leading two sets to one and falling just two points from the title in the fourth set.[105]\n\nThe 2009 season was perhaps the most historically relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen.[105] The Wimbledon final was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16\u201314 in the fifth set.[104]\n\nFederer finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fifth time in his career.\n\n2010: Fourth Australian Open\nMain article: 2010 Roger Federer tennis season\n\nFederer won a record 16th major at the 2010 Australian Open.\nFederer started the year with a win at the Australian Open,[108] where he defeated Andy Murray in the final, extending the Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles and matching Andre Agassi's record of four Australian Open titles.[88] Since Wimbledon 2005 Federer had made 18 out of 19 finals in Grand Slam tournaments, a period of sustained excellence unparalleled in the Open Era. This tournament, however, marked the end of his dominance at the majors.[109]\n\nAt the French Open, Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay.[108][110] However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2004 French Open,[111] losing to S\u00f6derling in the last 8 and relinquishing his No. 1 ranking,[108] having been just one week away from equaling Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks as world No. 1. In a huge upset at Wimbledon, Federer lost in the last 8 again to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych and fell to No. 3 in the rankings for the first time in 6 years and 8 months.[108][112][113]\n\nTowards the middle of July, Federer hired Pete Sampras' old coach Paul Annacone on a trial basis to put his tennis game and career back on track.[114] At the 2010 US Open Federer reached the semifinals, where he lost a five-set match to Novak Djokovic after holding two match points.[108] Federer made it to four Masters finals prevailing against Mardy Fish at the Cincinnati Masters.[115]\n\nFederer finished the year in strong form, winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss Indoors, and the ATP Finals in London bringing his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal for his fifth title at the event.[116] He beat all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. It remains the only tournament in his career where Federer defeated all fellow members of the Big Four.[117] In 2010 Federer finished in the top two for the eighth consecutive season.[118]\n\n2011: Tour Finals title record\nMain article: 2011 Roger Federer tennis season\nThe year 2011 was a lean year for Federer, although great by most player's standards. He was defeated in straight sets in the semifinals of the 2011 Australian Open by eventual champion Novak Djokovic,[119] marking the first time since July 2003 that he did not hold any of the four major titles. In the French Open semifinals, Federer ended Djokovic's undefeated streak of 43 consecutive wins with a four-set victory.[120] Federer then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal.[121] At Wimbledon Federer advanced to his 29th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. It marked the first time in his career that he had lost a Grand Slam tournament match after winning the first two sets.[122]\n\nAt the US Open Federer lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic in five sets. In a repeat of previous year's semifinal event, Federer again squandered two match points on his own serve before losing after winning first two sets for second consecutive time in the year. The loss meant that it was the first time since 2002 that Federer had not won any of the four grand slam titles.[123]\n\nIn September 2011, in a South African poll, Federer was voted the second most trusted and respected person in the world next to Nelson Mandela.[124][125]\n\nFederer finished the season successfully in the indoor season, winning his last three tournaments of the year at the Swiss Indoors, Paris Masters, and ATP Finals, forming a 16 match winning streak. Federer finished the year ranked No. 3.[126]", "response": "2009 was arguably the most important of his career since he won his first and only French Open title, completing the career grand slam. He was also able to surpass Pete Sampras' record of fourteen men's grand slam titles.\n\nUntil then, Federer had won the three other grand slams - Wimbledon, Australian Open and US Open but the French Open was elusive as he had to repeatedly compete on the clay court of Rolland Garros against Rafael Nadal, who was a clay court expert and he lost to him on multiple occasions.\n\n2004 was also an important year in Federer's career because he established dominance in the sport by winning three out of the four grand slams of the year and ending the year as the world number one for the first time in his long career.", "catgr": "smzt"}

The tour is approx. 40 mins long and you discover that gravity doesn't behave like it should or what should be higher than you turns out to be at same height or lower. You make a steep quick climb to a tilted cabin on a tilted road and you feel disoriented and seem to be at a severe incline when you enter this cabin. While there are various hypotheses as to reason for these effects, the most likely explanation is some level of optical illusion as the road is tilted at a severe opposite angle to the tilted roof line and the inside of the cabin. I think a combination of gravity hill where you get the sensation you are climbing up the road when in reality you are going down and the odd tilted angles of the cabin causes severe optical illusion. It also causes humans to fall back on visual senses more and ignore other senses which might be counter acting what you see.", "catgr": "gqa"}

The infra-red search and track sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced avionics, glass cockpits, helmet-mounted sights (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor data fusion for vastly improved situational awareness while easing the pilot's workload.[37] Avionics suites rely on extensive use of very high-speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed data buses.

Efficient implementations generally use a hybrid algorithm, combining an asymptotically efficient algorithm for the overall sort with insertion sort for small lists at the bottom of a recursion. Highly tuned implementations use more sophisticated variants, such as Timsort (merge sort, insertion sort, and additional logic), used in Android, Java, and Python, and introsort (quicksort and heapsort), used (in variant forms) in some C++ sort implementations and in .NET.\n\nFor more restricted data, such as numbers in a fixed interval, distribution sorts such as counting sort or radix sort are widely used. Bubble sort and variants are rarely used in practice, but are commonly found in teaching and theoretical discussions.\n\nWhen physically sorting objects (such as alphabetizing papers, tests or books) people intuitively generally use insertion sorts for small sets. For larger sets, people often first bucket, such as by initial letter, and multiple bucketing allows practical sorting of very large sets. Often space is relatively cheap, such as by spreading objects out on the floor or over a large area, but operations are expensive, particularly moving an object a large distance \u2013 locality of reference is important. Merge sorts are also practical for physical objects, particularly as two hands can be used, one for each list to merge, while other algorithms, such as heapsort or quicksort, are poorly suited for human use.

It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\nWhile Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years,[12] aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916.[13] In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2),[3] comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges.[11] Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.[14] Well over half of the world's geysers[15][16] and hydrothermal features[17] are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.[18] In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened.[11] The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest, and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.[19]", "response": "Generally considered to be the first national park in the world, Yellowstone National Park is significant in size, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and acts as the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystems.  The park is able to support many types of wildlife including Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, mountain goats, free-ranging herds of bison and elk, as well as many types of birds and fish, because of the diversity of habitats.  Forests and grasslands dominate some areas of the park, while others offer the completely different experience of mountain ranges, lakes, and rolling prairies.  Some of the park's most unique features are the geysers and hydrothermal features.  In fact, Yellowstone is home to over half of the world's features like these.  This is due to the entire park being centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent.", "catgr": "smzt"}

Some common names include gold-speckled flatworm, marine flatworm, yellow papillae flatworm, yellow-spotted flatworm, and yellow-spotted polyclad flatworm.Thysanozoon nigropapillosum has a long body and broad shape. They grow up to 3 in (76 mm).  The dorsal surface is deep black and covered with numerous yellow-tipped papillae varying in size. The ventral surface is dark brown. The outer margin of the body is slightly wavy and bordered in opaque white.  They have small, ear-like pseudotentacles in the middle of the anterior end. They swim by propelling themselves through the water with a rhythmic undulating motion of the body.This species is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific.Thysanozoon nigropapillosum is quite common along the external reef in the shallow sub-tidal zone. It can swim by undulating and rhythmically contracting the body margins. It feeds on tunicates, using its mouth and large pharynx to engulf Didemnum spp., and later regurgitates food pellets containing the calcareous spicules present in their tunics. Polyclad flatworms are hermaphrodites, with each one of a pair of flatworms trying to inseminate the other. Transfer of sperm may be by hypodermic insemination, but this is made difficult in this species by the presence of the papillae, and dermal impregnation often occurs. This involves sperm entering the body directly after being placed in the marginal region of the skin. Such dermal insemination is facilitated by the fact that the flatworm has two penises which are strengthened by the presence of rhabdites, and these can grip the margin of the partner and keep hold, even while the recipient is swimming.World Database of Marine SpeciesSeaslugsWormsZipcodezooGwannonPhotos of Thysanozoon nigropapillosum on Sealife Collection", "response": "Thysanozoon nigropapillosum is a species of polyclad flatworms belonging to the family Pseudocerotidae.
