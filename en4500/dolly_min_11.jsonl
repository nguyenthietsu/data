It was a market day, during which children were exempted from school[7] and agricultural workers stopped work in the field and came to the city to sell the produce of their labor[8][9] or to practice religious rites.[citation needed]\n\nThe French Revolutionary Calendar (1793–1805) had ten-day weeks (called décades) and allowed décadi, one out of the ten days, as a leisure day. From 1929 to 1940, the Soviet Union utilized a calendar with five and six-day work weeks, with a rest day assigned to a worker either with a colour or number.\n\nIn cultures with a four-day workweek, the three Sabbaths derive from the culture's main religious tradition: Friday (Muslim), Saturday (Jewish, Adventist), and Sunday (Christian).\n\nThe present-day concept of the relatively longer 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early 19th century[4] and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off starting at 2 pm on the basis that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.[10] The Oxford English Dictionary traces the first use of the term weekend to the British magazine Notes and Queries in 1879.[11]\n\nIn 1908, the first five-day workweek in the United States was instituted by a New England cotton mill so that Jewish workers would not have to work on the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.[12] In 1926, Henry Ford began shutting down his automotive factories for all of Saturday and Sunday, due to pressures stemming from the October Revolution,[citation needed] which witnessed the ruling class persecuted for not giving the laborers dignifying conditions. In 1929, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America was the first union to demand and receive a five-day workweek. The rest of the United States slowly followed, but it was not until 1940, when a provision of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act mandating a maximum 40-hour workweek went into effect, that the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide.[12]\n\nOver the succeeding decades, particularly in the 1940s to 1960s, an increasing number of countries adopted either a Friday–Saturday or a Saturday–Sunday weekend to harmonize with international markets. A series of workweek reforms in the mid-to-late 2000s and early 2010s brought much of the Arab World in synchronization with the majority of countries around the world, in terms of working hours, the length of the workweek, and the days of the weekend. The International Labour Organization (ILO) currently defines a workweek exceeding 48 hours as excessive. A 2007 study by the ILO found that at least 614.2 million people around the world were working excessive hours.[13]", "response": "The creation of a five-day workweek in the United States came about as a result of organizing by and pressure from workers and labor groups in the first half of the 20th century, as they demanded dignified working conditions from their employers and the ruling class.", "category": "closed_qa"}

Early versions of this networking model were known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model because the research and development were funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.\n\nThe Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking.[1][2] An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a protocol stack. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer, handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.\n\nThe technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Joe was an inspiring leader and had a knack for managing diverse species, thus he had attracted a sizable contingent of bears and birds to work at the inn. His most valued employees were a large polar bear who served as CFO, and a brown bear from Britain who was the hotel’s concierge. Additional staff members included a large brown bear who ran the shipping and receiving department, and a hen whose feathers made her an excellent housekeeper. Security was provided by a retired Canadian police bear and a retired British police bear. And because Joe recognized the importance of staying at the forefront of innovation, the inn employed a mole to research new hotel concepts. Lastly, the inn had a small polar bear on retainer as their attorney, and an Irish doctor bear to look after the medical needs of the staff and the very occasional guest who would stay at the inn. Amazingly, Joe and his CFO had convinced the staff to work in return only for housing and an occasional chocolate coin.\n\nAlthough the inn was very small, it offered guests various activities. The most popular was a whale watching cruise. Although the ship’s captain, a penguin, was not a skilled navigator, guests were guaranteed whale sightings on every voyage because the whales worked for the inn. The inn’s spa was focused on a small gym facility, and an emotional support bear offered counseling services so that guests could heal both their bodies and minds. The most popular guest dining spot was al fresco in the inn’s award-winning garden, where a pair of geese served as bartender and wine sommelier.

Recommend a ski resort in Tahoe including trails that I can use to follow the plan.", "context": "", "response": "Skiing is a fun sport with something for every age and skill level. The measure of \"hard\" in skiing may be subjective but as a general rule of thumb, trails become harder as the steepness or pitch increases, number and type of obstacles increase, the trail is bumpier or is narrower. Changes along these dimensions present new challenges and require a broader array of skills. \n\nA good way to progress along trails is to pick a trail that presents a challenge in one or two dimensions of \"hard\" to learn or refine skills. As you progress, you can increase the challenges along different dimensions. Labelling at ski resorts help with these choices. Trails are generally classified into bunny (easiest or learning greens), green (circle), blue (square), black (diamond) and double black (two diamonds). When you are learning skiing, it's best to get reasonably confident at a color before moving on to the next one. You don't have to be perfect but you have to feel safe as you progress. While colors are broadly useful, they can still be inexact as measures of hardness. Further, your strengths and weaknesses will also play a part in determining how hard a trail is for you personally. Staff at ski resorts can point you to good trails based on your personal comfort. Remember to always ski with a friend !\n\nFor following this plan, you should consider Kirkwood Ski Resort near South Lake Tahoe. Kirkwood has a reputation for some great advanced skiing trails but it presents many good trails for progressive improvement. If this is your first time skiing, a lesson is strongly recommended to learn the basics of keeping yourselves and those around you safe ! \n\nYou can start on the Timber Creek Area where there are a few bunny trails that are perfect for beginners. Funny bunny and School Run offer plenty of gentle practice for a new skier and when you are ready, ski Graduation (cue confetti). Squirrel Ridge and Snowkirk (on the Mountain Village side) are good next steps because they are long gentle greens.\n\nOnce you are feeling confident, Free 'N' Easy and Hole 'N' Wall offer a gentle introduction to blues. Blues at Kirkwood cater to a wide range of skills. The areas around Lower Zachary and Flying Carpet are good next challenges. If you are feeling good on those blues, try the backside with the appropriately named \"Happiness Is\"\n\nIf you've really got it down, it's time to try some black diamonds. Groomed blacks are easier to ski and fresh snow lowers the challenge further. Try Zachary and the trails around it. At this level, each black may offer a different kind of challenge. Hully Gully may have bumps and Lower Olympic is a nice introduction to a bowl.  There are many to choose from !\n\nThe final challenges are the double blacks and the The Wall is well known favorite. There are no dearth of double blacks and off piste trails at Kirkwood for those that have progressed beyond the labelling.\n\nHave fun and stay safe !", "category": "creative_writing"}

{"instruction": "What causes the sun to rise?", "context": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.", "response": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear.

{"instruction": "Given the below reference text about Luftwaffe, tell me for how many years was this military organisation active officially in Germany?", "context": "The Luftwaffe was the aerial-warfare branch of the German Wehrmacht before and during World War II. Germany's military air arms during World War I, the Luftstreitkräfte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of the Imperial Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 in accordance with the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles which banned Germany from having any air force.\n\nDuring the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in the Soviet Union. With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the Luftwaffe's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German rearmament and conscription would be announced on 16 March.[6] The Condor Legion, a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in September 1939.[7] By the summer of 1939, the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader (wings). The Luftwaffe also operated a paratrooper force known as the Fallschirmjäger.\n\nThe Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940. During the Battle of Britain, however, despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF's infrastructure and, during the subsequent Blitz, devastating many British cities, the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe's fighter arm. From late 1942, the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions. In addition to its service in the West, the Luftwaffe operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket-propelled aircraft for the destruction of Allied bombers, the Luftwaffe was overwhelmed by the Allies' superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority, and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of petroleum, oil, and lubricants after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined Wehrmacht military forces as a whole, the Luftwaffe ceased to be an effective fighting force.\n\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The Luftwaffe had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: Hermann Göring and later Generalfeldmarschall Robert Ritter von Greim for the last two weeks of the war.", "response": "The Luftwaffe was officially active for about 11 years - 1935 to 1946.", "category": "closed_qa"}

{"instruction": "Extract examples of electrical conduction from the following passage.", "context": "The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.  If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "response": "Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.", "category": "information_extraction"}

It is known to separate the \"Old World\" of Africa, Europe, and Asia from the \"New World\" of the Americas in the European perception of the World.\n\nThrough its separation from Africa, Europe, and Asia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations. While the Norse were the first humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the 1492 expedition of Christopher Columbus that proved to be the most consequential. Columbus's expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Spain, France, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. From the 16th to 19th centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was the center of both an eponymous slave trade and the Columbian exchange while occasionally hosting naval battles. Such naval battles, as well as growing trade from regional American powers like the United States and Brazil, both increased in degree during the 20th century, and while no major military conflicts took place in the Atlantic in the present 21st century, the ocean remains a core component of trade across the world.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and North and South America to the west. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica).

{"instruction": "What is this text about?", "context": "There are many modern variations of gazpacho with avocados, cucumbers, parsley, strawberries, watermelon, grapes, meat stock, seafood, and other ingredients instead of tomatoes and bread. The ingredients, texture, and thickness of gazpacho vary regionally and between different cooks. Similar cold raw soups such as arjamolho in Portugal, porra antequerana and ajoblanco, are also popular in Andalusia, although not as widespread as gazpacho. Gazpacho and salmorejo are especially similar since they are both tomato-based cold soups that are widely popular in Spain; the main difference between gazpacho and salmorejo is the culinary technique used since gazpacho is a soup whereas salmorejo is an emulsion. In addition, while both dishes share the main ingredients of tomato, olive oil, bread, and garlic, gazpacho can also be prepared with cucumber, peppers, and vinegar, whereas salmorejo cannot. The original recipe using bread, water, vinegar, oil, and salt is traditional in the Iberian Peninsula, perhaps going back to Roman times. Every central and southern region has its own variety. The humble gazpacho became a very deeply rooted food for peasants and shepherds in Spain. The basic gazpacho gave rise to many variants, some also called gazpacho, others not; some authors have tried to classify all these variations. Gazpachos may be classified by colour: the most usual red ones (which contain tomato), white ones (which contain no tomato, but include dried fruits), and green ones (which are white but contain some spices that make them green). These variants have their basic ingredients in common, including garlic paste which works as an emulsifier, bread, olive oil, vinegar and salt. In addition to the traditional ingredients, red fruits such as strawberries, muskmelon, etc., may be added, making the gazpacho a bit sweeter. Gazpacho may be served as a starter, main dish, or tapa.\n\nA popular variation comes from the town of Rota in the province of Cádiz. During times of drought, there was not enough water to make gazpacho; thus, arranque has the same ingredients as gazpacho, but requires less water and bread, making it a sort of cream. Some people add more bread until it takes on the consistency of a dip.\n\nIn Extremadura, gazpachos are a kind of purée or thick gazpacho known as cojondongo, or cojondongo del gañán, made of breadcrumbs, garlic, oil, and vinegar, then topped with chopped onions, tomato and peppers.\n\nGazpacho manchego, as its name implies, is made in the east region of La Mancha, in Albacete and nearby areas, and is popular in other areas in the center and southwest of the country. It is a meat stew, whose main ingredients are small game animals or birds such as rabbit, hare, quail, or pigeon, and flatbread, and may include garlic, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It is cooked in a cauldron and served hot. Another well-known variant in La Mancha is gazpacho de pastor or galiano. Some other hot meat or fish dishes from other regions are called gazpacho (gazpacho jumillano, gazpacho de Yecla, gazpacho de Requena, etc.)\n\nGazpacho is often eaten during the very hot and dry summers in Castilla y León. The gazpacho made in La Moraña in the province of Ávila has large pieces of vegetables floating in a watery soup.\n\nGazpacho manchego, despite its name, is a meat stew, served hot, not a variation on the cold vegetable soup.", "response": "This text is about variations of Gazpachos.

She’s in 9th grade, but attends a pretty small school, so everyone was milling about in a small area…playing cards or MahJong, eating baked goods they got from a sale down the hall, and generally, being teenagers. \nI don’t frequent her school often, but Mads seemed pretty happy, and in her element.  It was lovely to witness.\nI, on the other hand, was having a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day at work, and when I arrived, I was checking my phone for updates and trying to fight a battle for my new team that I was told was Very Much Not Worth Fighting.  Of course, this was unheeded advice, as—if there’s a hill that’s worth dying on—I will go prostrate myself upon the top of it as effectively as possible. \nAnd so I was fighting an Unwinnable War, and my daughter was overseeing a team of boys scarfing down brownies and picking at their healthy lunches and laughing whilst stacking their Chinese tiles…and I was so crestfallen about the outcome of my silent, onscreen, remote work battle that I didn’t even notice the tears welling up in my eyes, or the fact that I was sitting in the middle of a room filled with teenagers. \nI suppose the only good thing about crying in a room full of teenagers at lunch is that you’re very rarely the ONLY one crying…so there’s that.\nSo there I sat, in fine company, shoulders mildly hunched and trying my damnedest not to wipe my now-soggy nose on my sleeve.  And of course maintaining a smile any time Maddie looked over at me, because Lord knows I was there only to make sure no one flipped over a table (but honestly, not there for much else, as these kids were self-sufficient and rather shockingly well-behaved from what I remembered from 9th grade) and the last thing I wanted was to embarrass my daughter at her school lunch hour.\nBut Maddie was standing there next to the little sofa chair I was on, and she said, “Mom, scoot over.” \nAnd I scooted.\nAnd she sat. \nShe didn’t ask me what was wrong; she already had heard my rumblings before she left for school this morning about the particular work woe I was dealing with today.  Rather, she leaned over and gave me a big hug, right there in front of anyone paying attention—which seemed to be everyone—and assuaged me with soothing “it will all be fine”s and “didn’t I expect these kind of things from my work by now anyway?”s. \nAnd then she got up and went back to her perch at the game table, as nonchalantly as if she had just gotten a drink at the water fountain, and I was left thinking that my teenage daughter had just hugged me in public, in the high school lunch room, in front of two dozen other teenagers I had never met, and she didn’t even flinch. \nThree hours later, the issue at work actually ended up coming up roses;  turns out that dying on that Hill was able to save the initiative after all.   I was really, really happy about that.\nBut the best part of the day was the undeniable recognition that Maddie is Fearless, and Kind, and Confident, and willing to step across lines and do the hard things. She is going to be a Force of Nature. \nIndeed, she already is.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "How do you play baseball", "context": "", "response": "Baseball is a game that is played between two teams. The playing field is shaped like a diamond made up by four \"bases\" plus a pitching mound. Each team needs at least 9 players to occupy all field positions. Those positions are Catcher, Pitcher, First base, Second base, short stop, third base, left field, center field, and right field. The point of the game is to score more \"Runs\" than the other team. Each team takes turns trying to hit a ball pitched to them by the opposing teams pitcher. If you hit the ball you run in order from first base to second to third and then home. Once the ball is hit the other team can tag you out with the ball that you hit. Each base is a safe spot to stand so you can stop at any base and let the next person on your team try to hit the ball and advance you to the next base. If you are tagged out then your team has an out. You get three outs in an inning. Once there are three outs you switch from hitting to pitching with the other team. When you are batting you get three strikes and four balls. If the pitcher throws four balls then you can walk to first base. This is called a walk. If you swing and miss the ball, that is called a strike. You can also strike out by not swinging at a pitch that is in an imaginary strike zone. This zone is there to give the pitcher something to aim and the hitter a reasonable area to hit a ball. There are 8 innings in a game. After 8 turns being up to bat the team with more runs wins. The home team always hits last. There are lots of nuanced rules and it is most popular in the country that created it, the United States of America.", "category": "general_qa"}

Time can be a difficult indicator as how long it takes for a starter to double volume can vary based on temperature, hydration, and other factors. Another sign to look for is a lot of bubbles throughout the starter - this can be seen if your starter is in a glass container. Lastly, get to know your starter as you bake with it because each starter has its own unique characteristics. Learn what it will smell like when it matures - this can help you establish a baseline and identify when something is wrong with the starter as it smells \"funky\".", "category": "general_qa"}

It also responded to external challenges, especially against the competition, as Salesforce today competes in the CRM industry and emerged as a viable alternative to AWS. Salesforce relies more heavily on bureaucratic control mechanisms than clan and market control. Salesforce divided itself into functional units, namely, Product, Customer, People, Strategy, and Revenue. It does have some core focus areas, like the public sector as an industry vertical. Even though Salesforce, when viewed through a rational lens, is a bureaucratic organization, it is designed for flexibility, i.e, organic design. The decision-making is pushed down to the business unit rather than being driven by the top management.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines GDP as \"an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production and services (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs)\".[9] An IMF publication states that, \"GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services—that are bought by the final user—produced in a country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year).\"[10]\n\nGDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress. It is often considered to be the world's most powerful statistical indicator of national development and progress. However, critics of the growth imperative often argue that GDP measures were never intended to measure progress, and leave out key other externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work.[11] Critics frequently propose alternative economic models such as doughnut economics which use other measures of success or alternative indicators such as the OECD's Better Life Index as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being.", "response": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measurement of all of the goods and services sold in a specific country over a specific time period.

Research your new plants' preferred sunlight, water, and humidity requirements so you can provide the best care. Second, be sure to review your newly acquired houseplant for any pests before introducing them into your home. You’ll want to check the leaves for mealy bugs, spider mites, etc. and the soil for pests such as fungus gnats. If you find any of these be sure to quarantine your new plant away from your current plants and treat with a pesticide of your choosing. Many houseplant owners use neem oil to treat pests. Third, upsize or repot your plant only when it is ready. Your new plant likely will be happy for a while in its current nursery (plastic) container that it came home from the shop in. You can choose to upsize the pot once you notice signs of the plant being root bound (the roots take up a majority of the pot) such as water draining from the pot quickly and the soil not becoming saturated or the plant slows its growth of new leaves (unless its the winter season at which time plants naturally slow or stop new growth).

This theory originated with Czech philosopher Radovan Richta.[5]\n\nMankind In Transition; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future, Masefield Books, 1993.[6] Technology (which Richta defines as \"a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value\") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:\n\nThe pre-technological period, in which all other animal species remain today (aside from some avian and primate species) was a non-rational period of the early prehistoric man.\n\nThe emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a microscope, manipulating heavy objects with a pulley and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.\n\nThe second technological stage was the creation of the machine. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes part of or all of the element of human physical effort, requiring only the control of its functions. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though windmills, a type of machine, are much older.\n\nExamples of this include cars, trains, computers, and lights. Machines allow humans to tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.\n\nThe third, and final stage of technological evolution is the automation. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are digital watches, automatic telephone switches, pacemakers, and computer programs.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology, and so all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.", "response": "the first stage: the tool.

Quite the opposite: I threw myself into swimming. We all pushed ourselves to be the best we could be, we cheered as loud as we could on the sidelines, and no one passed up an opportunity to support the team or attend a team outing. Because Coach didn’t just build teams of champion swimmers, she built a community. I’m still close to many of my teammates — some remain my closest friends.

Proliferation has been opposed by many nations with and without nuclear weapons, as governments fear that more countries with nuclear weapons will increase the possibility of nuclear warfare (up to and including the so-called countervalue targeting of civilians with nuclear weapons), de-stabilize international or regional relations, or infringe upon the national sovereignty of nation states.\n\nFour countries besides the five recognized Nuclear Weapons States have acquired, or are presumed to have acquired, nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel. None of these four is a party to the NPT, although North Korea acceded to the NPT in 1985, then withdrew in 2003 and conducted its first nuclear test in 2006.[1] One critique of the NPT is that the treaty is discriminatory in the sense that only those countries that tested nuclear weapons before 1968 are recognized as nuclear weapon states while all other states are treated as non-nuclear-weapon states who can only join the treaty if they forswear nuclear weapons.[2]\n\nResearch into the development of nuclear weapons was initially undertaken during World War II by the United States (in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada), Germany, Japan, and the USSR. The United States was the first and is the only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war, when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945. After surrendering to end the war, Germany and Japan ceased to be involved in any nuclear weapon research. In August 1949, the USSR tested a nuclear weapon, becoming the second country to detonate a nuclear bomb.[3] The United Kingdom first tested a nuclear weapon in October 1952. France first tested a nuclear weapon in 1960. The People's Republic of China detonated a nuclear weapon in 1964. India conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, which prompted Pakistan to develop its own nuclear program and, when India conducted a second series of nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan followed with a series of tests of its own.

{"instruction": "What is photosynthesis?", "context": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek phōs (φῶς), \"light\", and synthesis (σύνθεσις), \"putting together\".[1][2][3] Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.[4]\n\nAlthough photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.", "response": "Photosynthesis is\n- a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy \n- a word derived from the Greek phōs (φῶς), \"light\", and synthesis (σύνθεσις), \"putting together\"\n- a process that always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers\n- performed differently by different species\n- largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere", "category": "summarization"}

We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent.

{"instruction": "How is the white color created?", "context": "", "response": "The color white is created when all colors in the visible spectrum are combined in equal amounts. This can be seen in a prism or a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its component colors. When all these colors are combined, the result is white light.\n\nIn terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.\n\nIn the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity. This creates a pure white color on electronic displays.", "category": "general_qa"}

If you are a carnivore, perhaps you might enjoy a steak or chicken dinner with a side or asparagus and a baked potato that has a knob of butter on top! Other common dinner options include pasta, burgers, quesadillas, poke bowls, sushi, Mediterranean kebabs, falafel sandwiches, soup, etc.", "category": "general_qa"}
{"instruction": "What is genome analysis?", "context": "", "response": "The genome sequence of an organism includes the collective DNA sequences of each chromosome in the organism. For a bacterium containing a single chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that chromosome. For the human species, whose genome includes 22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, a complete genome sequence will involve 46 separate chromosome sequences.\n\nThe Human Genome Project is a well known example of a genome project.\n\nGenome assembly refers to the process of taking a large number of short DNA sequences and reassembling them to create a representation of the original chromosomes from which the DNA originated. In a shotgun sequencing project, all the DNA from a source (usually a single organism, anything from a bacterium to a mammal) is first fractured into millions of small pieces. These pieces are then \"read\" by automated sequencing machines. A genome assembly algorithm works by taking all the pieces and aligning them to one another, and detecting all places where two of the short sequences, or reads, overlap. These overlapping reads can be merged, and the process continues.\n\nGenome assembly is a very difficult computational problem, made more difficult because many genomes contain large numbers of identical sequences, known as repeats. These repeats can be thousands of nucleotides long, and occur different locations, especially in the large genomes of plants and animals.\n\nThe resulting (draft) genome sequence is produced by combining the information sequenced contigs and then employing linking information to create scaffolds. Scaffolds are positioned along the physical map of the chromosomes creating a \"golden path\".\n\nOriginally, most large-scale DNA sequencing centers developed their own software for assembling the sequences that they produced. However, this has changed as the software has grown more complex and as the number of sequencing centers has increased. An example of such assembler Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis.\n\nSince the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying attaching biological information to sequences , and particularly in identifying the locations of genes and determining what those genes do.\n\nWhen sequencing a genome, there are usually regions that are difficult to sequence (often regions with highly repetitive DNA). Thus, 'completed' genome sequences are rarely ever complete, and terms such as 'working draft' or 'essentially complete' have been used to more accurately describe the status of such genome projects. Even when every base pair of a genome sequence has been determined, there are still likely to be errors present because DNA sequencing is not a completely accurate process. It could also be argued that a complete genome project should include the sequences of mitochondria and (for plants) chloroplasts as these organelles have their own genomes.\n\nIt is often reported that the goal of sequencing a genome is to obtain information about the complete set of genes in that particular genome sequence. The proportion of a genome that encodes for genes may be very small (particularly in eukaryotes such as humans, where coding DNA may only account for a few percent of the entire sequence). However, it is not always possible (or desirable) to only sequence the coding regions separately. Also, as scientists understand more about the role of this noncoding DNA (often referred to as junk DNA), it will become more important to have a complete genome sequence as a background to understanding the genetics and biology of any given organism.\n\nIn many ways genome projects do not confine themselves to only determining a DNA sequence of an organism. Such projects may also include gene prediction to find out where the genes are in a genome, and what those genes do. There may also be related projects to sequence ESTs or mRNAs to help find out where the genes actually are.", "category": "open_qa"}

Although there have been many different swing styles over the years, there are fundamentals to playing the game that when followed, have produced the most successful golfers. \n\nBuilding a strong golf foundation using 4 key principles is key to improving at the game of golf which are: aligning your expectations to reality, applying an effective on course strategy, practicing correctly, and, building a sharp mental game.\n\nBy aligning your expectations to the reality of how you are playing, you allow your mind to accept the good with the bad which allows for a more free and easy playing style, often leading to better play.\n\nApplying an effective course strategy will allow you to score better as you know where you can make up strokes on your competitors.  For example, driving distance off the tee paired with greens in regulation play a crucial role in scoring, as opposed to putting whereas you have a 20 foot putt compared to a 40 foot putt, your make percentages are both low.\n\nLearning how to practice correctly can also improve your on course scoring as most approach practice incorrectly.  Zombie range sessions have become the norm, but rarely in golf do you have the same shot twice in a row.  Implement that same theory on the driving range so you have more of a feel of what on course play will feel like.\n\nFinally, in order to improve your scoring, you need to build a sharp mental game while you play.  This includes visualizing your shot before you hit it, being able to clear your head of all unwanted thoughts other than the shot you want to hit, and implementing a pre shot routine that is easily replicable.\n\nBy applying these core 4 strategies, you should see your golf scores decrease without any significant change in your actual swing.", "category": "general_qa"}

The first four developers were Martin Traverso, Dain Sundstrom, David Phillips, and Eric Hwang. Before Presto, the data analysts at Facebook relied on Apache Hive for running SQL analytics on their multi-petabyte data warehouse.[2] Hive was deemed too slow for Facebook's scale and Presto was invented to fill the gap to run fast queries.[3] Original development started in 2012 and deployed at Facebook later that year. In November 2013, Facebook announced its open source release.[3][4]\n\nIn 2014, Netflix disclosed they used Presto on 10 petabytes of data stored in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).[5] In November, 2016, Amazon announced a service called Athena that was based on Presto.[6] In 2017, Teradata spun out a company called Starburst Data to commercially support Presto, which included staff acquired from Hadapt in 2014.[7] Teradata's QueryGrid software allowed Presto to access a Teradata relational database.[8]\n\nIn January 2019, the Presto Software Foundation was announced. The foundation is a not-for-profit organization for the advancement of the Presto open source distributed SQL query engine.[9][10] At the same time, Presto development forked: PrestoDB maintained by Facebook, and PrestoSQL maintained by the Presto Software Foundation, with some cross pollination of code.\n\nIn September 2019, Facebook donated PrestoDB to the Linux Foundation, establishing the Presto Foundation.[11] Neither the creators of Presto, nor the top contributors and committers, were invited to join this foundation.[12]\n\nBy 2020, all four of the original Presto developers had joined Starburst.[13] In December 2020, PrestoSQL was rebranded as Trino, since Facebook had obtained a trademark on the name \"Presto\" (also donated to the Linux Foundation).[14]\n\nAnother company called Ahana was announced in 2020, with seed funding from GV (formerly Google Ventures, an arm of Alphabet, Inc.), to commercialize the PrestoDB fork as a cloud service, while also offering an open-source version.[15] A $20 million round of funding for Ahana was announced in August 202", "response": "Starburst", "category": "information_extraction"}

The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue, which he used to keep a fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie's guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top), which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr's father.[203] As for his usage of plectrums, Vaughan preferred Fender medium gauge guitar picks, using one of the rounder shoulders of the pick rather than the pointed tip to pluck and strum the strings.", "response": "SRV is known to have used Fender's medium gauge picks, but with an interesting quirk - he preferred the rounder edge over the pointy tip, which most players use.", "category": "closed_qa"}

In Canada, the term automated banking machine (ABM) is also used, although ATM is also very commonly used in Canada, with many Canadian organizations using ATM over ABM. In British English, the terms cashpoint, cash machine and hole in the wall are most widely used. Other terms include any time money, cashline, tyme machine, cash dispenser, cash corner, bankomat, or bancomat. ATMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as \"white-label\" ATMs.\n\nUsing an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions, most notably cash withdrawals and balance checking, as well as transferring credit to and from mobile phones. ATMs can also be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's exchange rate. Customers are typically identified by inserting a plastic ATM card (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a personal identification number (PIN), which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped), or in the issuing financial institution's database.", "category": "open_qa"}

There are nine small square reliefs relating to printers[9] and a large sculpture of Caledonia by Alexander Handyside Ritchie.\n\nRecords for 1890, the first full year the library was open, show that over 440,000 book loans were issued.[3]\n\nCentral library has been adapted and expanded many times over the years.[10] Only a year after opening the library was already running out of space and a book store was added in 1903. By 1928, the library was short of space again. Proposals were made for a better use of the space and a public lift was installed.\n\nIn 1930, the adjacent building at no.3 George IV Bridge was acquired allowing the library to expand again.[8] Further nearby premises were bought in the 1940s and in 1961, a mezzanine level was created above the former Newspaper Room.[10]\n\nIn May 2014, the new children's and music libraries were opened within the main library building.

Leaders with high EQ are interested in learning about what makes their employees tick, and they are aware that many people have completely different motivations. For example, a manager with high EQ understands that even though they may not personally be motivated primarily by receiving positive feedback, that if someone on their team becomes extremely motivated by praise for a job well done, they must make sure they are regularly delivering the kudos that employee thrives on.

How did the Spanish Empire treat its overseas territories?", "context": "", "response": "The Spanish Empire lasted for four centuries, from the arrival of Columbus in America in 1492 until the loss of its last overseas territories (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines) in 1898. In its last period, towards the middle of the 19th century, a debate arose that, to this day, still raises blisters regarding the definition of these lands. A part of the population continues to consider that the lands that Spain conquered beyond the seas were colonies, while another part defines them as provinces. That is, like Valladolid, Barcelona or Guadalajara.\nIn the Royal Decree of Carlos V, promulgated in 1519, which was later included in the Compilation of Laws of the Indies, the following declaration of intent could already be read: «That the West Indies be always united to the Crown of Castile and that cannot be alienated. We order that, at no time, they can be separated by our royal crown of Castile, disunited or divided in whole or in part or in favor of any person.»\nThe Spanish laws always spoke of \"provinces\", \"kingdoms\", \"republics\", \"empires\" or \"territories of islands and mainland\". In other words, the term \"colony\" was never used in the legal field for the territories that had been incorporated into the Crown of Castile. It was incorporated later and only with a critical and propagandistic desire, the same as it is today when it is used. This is not an excuse to deny that in the Spanish overseas territories there were models of exploitation that could be considered colonial, such as the monopoly of the extraction of precious metals or certain types of commercial companies. One of the main proofs is that the overseas territories reproduced most of the institutions of the metropolis.\nBernardino Bravo Lira, winner of Chile's 2010 National History Award, noted an important difference:\n\"Politically, the Indies were incorporated into the Crown and not into the Kingdom of Castile. This means that they were not considered as simple land, without their own political personality and, therefore, susceptible to submission to a foreign power. They were considered as other kingdoms, similar to Castile and other Europeans, endowed with the same attributes as them. For this reason they were classified and organized under the form of State of the Indies and not colonies. The kingdoms of the Indies had all the elements that then made up a State: territory, population, nationality, institutions, government and their own legislation.\"\nThis means that, contrary to what most critical authors think, the territories conquered by Spain were never considered as colonies devoid of rights. Moreover, its inhabitants were considered, already with Queen Isabella of Castilla, vassals of the Crown like any other inhabitant of the Iberian Peninsula, once the conquest process was completed in the 16th century. That is why the Indies, which have been known as \"America\" ​​since the 17th century, owed allegiance only to the King, who governed through the institutions created for that purpose and which were governed by officials designated for that purpose.", "category": "classification"}

{"instruction": "What is DNA sequence assembly?", "context": "", "response": "In bioinformatics, sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments from a longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence. This is needed as DNA sequencing technology might not be able to 'read' whole genomes in one go, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 30,000 bases, depending on the technology used. Typically, the short fragments (reads) result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).\n\nThe problem of sequence assembly can be compared to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and piecing the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos. Excerpts from another book may also be added in, and some shreds may be completely unrecognizable.", "category": "open_qa"}

{"instruction": "What is the sport of Ultimate?", "context": "", "response": "Ultimate, originally known as ultimate frisbee, is a non-contact team sport played with a disc flung by hand. Ultimate was developed in 1968 by AJ Gator in Maplewood, New Jersey. Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. The term \"frisbee\" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called \"ultimate Frisbee\", though this name is still in common casual use. Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.", "category": "general_qa"}
{"instruction": "how can you generate passive income?", "context": "", "response": "Compared with active income which you earn in exchange of your time and efforts, passive income comes passively as you can sit aside after proper initial setups. Some argue that time-average investing in index funds is considered passive investing. Time-average-investing or dollar cost averaging investing means you invest a fixed amount in the index fund recurringly with a given frequency, usually monthly or biweekly, regardless of the fund price. You can set it up with auto-payment or auto-investment through your brokerage and let it build your wealth over time. Index funds mirror the performance of a collection of selected stocks, thus providing a diversified strategy by its nature. SP500 index has a proven performance record that beats most active fund managers. In addition, real estate investment is somehow passive if you leave all the property management to professionals. However, the fact that it requires a certain amount of equity to get started makes younger investors shy away from it. For the younger generation, generating passive income from content they publish on social media has become a popular choice. For example, publishing videos to your YouTube channel requires time and effort to create the content. But once the video is live, it starts to generate income streams with more and more people watching your videos for years to come.", "category": "brainstorming"}

In the 18th century, it was partitioned three times by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and ceased to exist as an independent state for over a century\n\nDuring World War II, Poland was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany, resulting in the deaths of over six million Polish citizens, including three million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. Following the war, Poland became a satellite state of the Soviet Union and was occupied by Soviet forces until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.\n\nThroughout its history, Poland has also been invaded by other powers, including the Mongols, Teutonic Knights, and Ottoman Empire, among others. The country's location in central Europe, as well as its fertile land and valuable resources, have made it a target for invasion throughout history.\n\nOverall, while there is no definitive answer to which country has been the most invaded in history, Poland's history of being invaded and occupied by numerous neighboring powers makes it a strong contender for this title.", "category": "general_qa"}
