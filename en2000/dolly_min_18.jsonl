This change was primarily due to the impact of big data and the computational opportunities afforded to predictive analytics.\n\nDatafication is not the same as digitization, which takes analog content—books, films, photographs—and converts it into digital information, a sequence of ones and zeros that computers can read. Datafication is a far broader activity: taking all aspects of life and turning them into data [...] Once we datafy things, we can transform their purpose and turn the information into new forms of value[2]", "response": "The examples provided in the above passage for analog content are: books; films; photographs.", "category": "information_extraction"}

This is achieved by attacking the fire from the flanks, or the rear, so that burnt ground is always nearby, and the fire is always in front of the firefighters. This avoids two disadvantages of attacking fires at the head of the fire where spot fires may start behind them or changes in wind behavior might accelerate the spread of the fire.\n\nThe result of several inquiries into firefighter death in Australian bushfires found that firefighters should stay out of the dead man zone and that they should always keep 250 liters of water in their truck for personal safety. This is now a standard operating procedure in the NSW Rural Fire Service, Country Fire Service and Country Fire Authority in Australia.", "response": "Firefighters keep out of the dead man zone and carry large amounts of water (at least 250 liters) with them.", "category": "closed_qa"}

They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\n\nDescription\nThe size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 115 mm. The shell of Conus Episcopatus is elongated and has a high spire, which means that it has a tall apex. The shell is relatively thick and heavy, with a glossy surface and a series of raised ridges or ribs that run along its length. The overall shape of the shell is conical, with a pointed apex and a wider base.\n\nThe coloration of the shell can vary widely, but it basically has a base color of white or cream, with a series of darker or lighter bands, blotches, or spots that form complex patterns. The patterns can be quite intricate and unique, which is one reason why cone snails are prized by collectors.\n\nLike all cone snails, Conus Episcopatus is venomous and uses its venom to immobilize and kill its prey. Venom is delivered through a harpoon-like structure called a radula tooth located on the proboscis of the snail. The venom of some species of cone snail can be highly toxic and dangerous to humans, and care must be taken when handling them.", "response": "The shell size ranges from 40mm to 115mm and has a base color of white or cream with series of darker or lighter blotches that form complex patterns.", "category": "closed_qa"}

Lauder made the claim that lipstick sales could be an economic indicator, in that purchases of cosmetics – lipstick in particular – tend to be inversely correlated to economic health. The speculation was that women substitute lipstick for more expensive purchases like dresses and shoes in times of economic distress.\nLauder identified the Lipstick index as sales across the Estee Lauder family of brands. Subsequent recessions, including the late-2000s recession, provided controverting evidence to Lauder's claims, as sales have actually fallen with reduced economic activity. Conversely, lipstick sales have experienced growth during periods of increased economic activity. As a result, the lipstick index has been discredited as an economic indicator. The increased sales of cosmetics in 2001 has since been attributed to increased interest in celebrity-designed cosmetics brands.\nIn the 2010s, many media outlets reported that with the rise of nail art as fad in the English-speaking countries and as far afield as Japan and the Philippines, nailpolish had replaced lipstick as the main affordable indulgence for women in place of bags and shoes during recession, leading to talk of a nail polish index.Similar sentiment was noted during the coronavirus pandemic, when the mandated use of face masks to prevent the spread of the disease resulted in an increase of eye makeup purchases, suggesting a Mascara index", "response": "The lipstick index is a term coined by Leonard Lauder, chairman of the board of Estee Lauder, used to describe increased sales of cosmetics during the early 2000s recession.", "category": "summarization"}

Pulse tools use oil as a medium to transfer the kinetic energy from the hammer into the anvil. This gives a smoother impulse, a slightly lower torque to weight ratio and a possibility to design a shut off mechanism that shuts the tool down when achieving the correct torque.

{"instruction": "How can the Federal Reserve control inflation?", "context": "", "response": "The Federal Reserve has a \"dual mandate\" to both keep prices stable and maintain the highest level of sustainable employment. Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and \"Fed Speak\" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds. These tools involve buying/selling US treasuries or providing assurances to select credit markets. These actions can tighten/loosen these credit markets and therfore indirectly influence actual interest rates. In summary, all three tools used by the Fed play a part in the strategy for controlling inflation.", "category": "open_qa"}

The saxophone is a transposing instrument that is commonly keyed in B flat and E flat, and less commonly being keyed in concert C.  There are four types of saxophones that are widely used including Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Baritone.  Two versions, namely the Sopranino and the Bass, are produced by a very few manufacturers and are far less common and rarely used in most modern music.  The instrument is used in a variety of musical genres including classical, jazz, fusion, funk, rock and roll, R&B, Hiphop, and even country music.  Well known players of the saxophone include Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Stan Getz, Sonny Stitt, Gerry Mulligan, Michael Brecker, David Sanborn, Art Pepper, Maceo Parker, Dexter Gordon, Candy Dulfer, Phil Woods, Mindi Abair, Chris Potter, Josh Redman, and many, many more.", "category": "general_qa"}

Previous versions of the theorem date back to 1811, but in its modern general form, this fundamental result in probability theory was precisely stated as late as 1920,[1] thereby serving as a bridge between classical and modern probability theory.", "response": "For example, suppose that a sample is obtained containing many observations, each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the arithmetic mean of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the probability distribution of the average will closely approximate a normal distribution.\n\nThe central limit theorem has several variants. In its common form, the random variables must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In variants, convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions or for non-independent observations, if they comply with certain conditions.\n\nThe earliest version of this theorem, that the normal distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, is the de Moivre–Laplace theorem.", "category": "information_extraction"}

{"instruction": "How do you make pizza?", "context": "", "response": "Pizza comes in many styles. I make Neapolitan pizza, which generally requires a high hydration dough and a very high oven temperatures. The dough is made with four cups of flour, three tablespoons olive oil, a cup and a half of water, one package of yeast, a tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon and a half of salt. I typically activate the yeast in lukewarm water and sugar first, then mix all the ingredients in a stand mixer with a dough attachment. I'll add additional water until the dough is very wet, let it rise once in the mixing bowl, then turn the dough out on a surface coated generously with flour. Then I quarter the dough, fold a few times, and let rise again. \n\nForming the pies is the tricky part. I've found pushing the dough into a rough circle with my fingers as a first step works well, but he dough will tend to snap back. I'll pick up the small dough circle and stretch it out on top of my fists to start to break the gluten and form a larger pie with a thinner base. I use an Ooni oven pre-heated on high, but turn the heat down when I'm ready to put the pizza in. The peel needs to be generously coated with flour to get a good launch into the oven. After a few seconds, the dough on the bottom will cook enough that manipulating the pizza becomes much easier. I keep the toppings simple, mozzarella (low moisture), tomato sauce, basil. \n\nEnjoy!", "category": "general_qa"}

In fact, it can be an important part of the \"checks and balances\" of a democracy (see France, South Korea, etc.) One of the factors you can look at when determining if the justice system is being abused or not is the number of cases/indictments being brought against the former head of government.

Some other uncommon birthdays in the West are January 1, December 24, and April 1.\n\nThe least common birthday is usually a holiday when most people take time off work. There are multiple reasons why these days have fewer births, but one reason is that doctors are less likely to schedule cesarean births on such days. April 1 is an exception, and is likely because parents who are able to choose not to give birth on that day, to prevent their children from being bullied for having their birthday on April Fool's Day.\n\nThis question is harder to answer in many non-Western countries as there is less easily accessible data. For example in a survey of students in India between 2007 and 2012, the statistics show much more births just before school opens, and on round days like the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.

The blades may be powered by manual force, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that when the mower is pushed forward, the blades spin or the machine may have a battery-powered or plug-in electric motor. The most common self-contained power source for lawn mowers is a small (typically one cylinder) internal combustion engine. Smaller mowers often lack any form of propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; \"walk-behind\" mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled \"walk-behind\" types or more often, are \"ride-on\" mowers, equipped so the operator can ride on the mower and control it.

{"instruction": "What are the different types of stances in tennis?", "context": "Stance refers to the way a player prepares themselves in order to best be able to return a shot. Essentially, it enables them to move quickly in order to achieve a particular stroke. There are four main stances in modern tennis: open, semi-open, closed, and neutral. All four stances involve the player crouching in some manner: as well as being a more efficient striking posture, it allows them to isometrically preload their muscles in order to play the stroke more dynamically. What stance is selected is strongly influenced by shot selection. A player may quickly alter their stance depending on the circumstances and the type of shot they intend to play. Any given stance also alters dramatically based upon the actual playing of the shot with dynamic movements and shifts of body weight occurring.", "response": "There are four main stances in tennis.

A subset of Euclidean space in particular is called compact if it is closed and bounded.

Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as sequential compactness and limit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces.\n\nIn contrast, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent in general topological spaces, and the most useful notion of compactness — originally called bicompactness — is defined using covers consisting of open sets (see Open cover definition below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the Heine–Borel theorem. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known locally — in a neighbourhood of each point of the space — and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space. An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is uniformly continuous; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.", "response": "According to the Heine-Borel theorem the following properties are sufficient to show that a subset of Euclidean space is compact:\n- The set is closed\n- The set is bounded", "category": "information_extraction"}

It also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.", "response": "An example of aliasing that easy to understand as a layman is the 'wagon wheel effect'. You've probably seen the wagon wheel effect when watching a movie or tv show and the wheels of a car appear to be spinning backwards even as the car moves forwards. This is an effect of aliasing. This occurs because the sampling rate of the film is not adequate to capture the frequency of the signal (the frequency that the tires are spinning forwards) and the signal becomes indistinguishable from another signal (a frequency of the tires spinning backwards). As an example of how this happens imagine that the camera's sampling rate allows it to record an image frame at about 90% of the frequency that the tires are spinning. That is, the tire is spinning fast enough that it rotates 90% around in between each picture the camera can take. In this case, the wheel will look like its rotated backwards by 10% of a rotation on each image.

{"instruction": "What is the last step before a star collapses into a black hole?", "context": "", "response": "Stars that have a higher mass than about 2.2 solar masses (the mass of our Sun) will typically collapse into black holes at the end of their life cycle when fusion has stopped and no longer pushes out against the inward pull of gravity. For stars of this mass, their inward pull of gravity is too strong to be resisted by other forces, thus their fate is to become black holes. However, stars under this limit and above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses will end their lifecycles as neutron stars. Neutron stars are also the remnants of dead stars but since they have a smaller mass, their gravity is not enough for them to cross into becoming black holes. As the dead star compresses and becomes more and more dense, regular matter is turned into neutrons and the last force to resist the pull of gravity is called degenerate neutron pressure, which is a quantum effect that dictates that no two neutrons may be in the same quantum state. This creates an outward pressure that resists the pull of gravity and settles the star into a neutron star. If more mass is added later, from a star companion or other sources, once the star's mass crosses the limit of around 2.2 solar masses even degenerate neutron pressure isn't enough to balance gravity and the star will collapse into a black hole.", "category": "open_qa"}

The problem is stated as follows: Imagine you are a contestant on a game show and the host shows you 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car and behind the other two are goats. The prizes have been randomly assigned to the doors and you want to win the car. The host allows you to pick one of the doors as a first selection. Then, the host opens one of the remaining doors and reveals a goat is behind it. The host now allows you to decide if you want to switch from your selected door to the remaining unopened door. Should you switch, to maximize your probability of winning the car?\n\nMost people believe switching does not improve your probability of winning the car. However switching does increase your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. An intuitive way to understand this problem is by first considering the initial state. At your first selection the probability that you have selected the right door is 1/3 and the probability that the car remains behind one of the two unselected doors is 2/3. Then the host reveals more information. The host reveals that one of the unselected doors does not have the car behind it. The probability that the originally unselected doors must have the car behind one of them is still 2/3, but you now know one of them specifically which does not have the car. Therefore, the remaining unopened unselected door must have a probability of 2/3 to contain the car, and your originally selected door must have a probability of 1/3. When offered the chance, you should switch to maximize your chances of winning the car.", "category": "open_qa"}

The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.\n\nAnother advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  \n\nGive this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising.", "category": "open_qa"}

{"instruction": "How is digital switching possible?", "context": "Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes digital switching possible, and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.\nToday, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The underlying principles that explain how semiconductors work are studied in solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems are part of electronics engineering.", "response": "The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes digital switching possible.", "category": "information_extraction"}
