It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.[1] If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.[2]", "response": "Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

{"instruction": "Can you give me a short summary of Mindfulness and how to practice it?", "context": "", "response": "Mindfulness is a technique that can be used to bring your mind and focus into the present moment, and calm your nervous system.\n\nThe most common way to begin to practice mindfulness is to narrow and focus your attention on your breath. Some techniques prefer breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth, although this is not required. One way to narrow your attention is to closely observe the sensation of cool air as it passes over the tip of your nose, and the sensation of your chest falling as you exhale. Allow any rising thoughts to pass through your mind without paying attention to them, or engaging with them.\n\nOther techniques involve focusing your attention to sensations in your body like hot and cold, or pain. You can also bring your focus to feelings like fear, anxiety, or love - focus your attention on where exactly in the body you feel those feelings. You can also move your attention to external stimulus like sounds, and your visual field.\n\nMindfulness is an extremely powerful technique that anyone can do from anywhere.

Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.\n\nIn the course of the warship's eight-month career, Bismarck conducted only one offensive operation that lasted 8 days in May 1941, codenamed Rheinübung. The ship, along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the battlecruiser HMS Hood initially engaged Prinz Eugen, probably by mistake, while HMS Prince of Wales engaged Bismarck. In the ensuing battle Hood was destroyed by the combined fire of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen, which then damaged Prince of Wales and forced her retreat. Bismarck suffered sufficient damage from three hits by Prince of Wales to force an end to the raiding mission.\n\nThe destruction of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for occupied France to effect repairs, Bismarck was attacked by fifteen Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning, the already-crippled Bismarck was engaged by two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, and sustained incapacitating damage and heavy loss of life. The ship was scuttled to prevent her being boarded by the British, and to allow the ship to be abandoned so as to limit further casualties. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually.\n\nThe wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard, and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.", "response": "The Bismarck was a battleship built for the German Navy in World War 2.  After one offensive engagement where it helped sink the ship HMS Hood the Bismarck became a priority target of the British Navy and was sunk by German forces after suffering catastrophic damage after only 8 months of service.", "category": "information_extraction"}

In those same years, the Japanese government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer project. Another encouraging event in the early 1980s was the revival of connectionism in the work of John Hopfield and David Rumelhart. Once again, AI had achieved success.[138]\n\nThe rise of expert systems\nAn expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.[139]\n\nExpert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point.[140]\n\nIn 1980, an expert system called XCON was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation. It was an enormous success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986.[141] Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments.[142] An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.[143]", "response": "An expert system is a program that uses logical rules derived from expert knowledge to answer questions or solve problems in a specific domain of knowledge.

{"instruction": "What is the best surface to run on?", "context": "", "response": "Running is a great exercise, but not all running surfaces are created equal. Traditionally, those who run \"runners\" will run 5-7 days a week. Runners will average between 3 miles per run up to 20 miles per run. While running is great exercise and very efficient at burning calories, it can be hard on the body. Specifically the leg joints. The average runner will strike the surface they are running on 1,480 times per mile. So if you are running 10 miles, thats just under 15,000 foot strikes. This repetitive striking can deteriorate the body joints over time. Therefore, the type of surface a runner runs on, can have a huge impact on the body. Some surfaces are harder than others, the harder the surface, the harder on the body, legs and joints. Concrete is harder than asphalt, asphalt is harder than a dirt trail and a dirt trail is harder than a high school track surface. Example, concrete can be 30% harder surface than asphalt. Running is a great exercise and millions of people enjoy running. But if you want to run long, as in for a long time, choose your running surface for the long run. Because the surface you choose to run on, can have a direct correlation to how long your body and leg joints will last.", "category": "brainstorming"}

Other states in the United States have similar provisions regarding classified boards.\n\nFor boards that have only 1 class, each director serves a fixed term (generally 1 year), and each director is subject to re-election each year.  \n\nClassified boards (also known as staggered boards) are divided into three separate classes (in equal proportion, to the extent possible), with members of each class serving three-year terms and only one class of directors up for election in any year.  \n\nA classified board is one type of protection that companies consider as part of a wider range review of corporate defensive measures.  Generally, corporate defensive measures relate to measures for a company to consider to protect against (1) hostile takeovers that the board believes do not reflect the value of the company and (2) short-termism, where there is pressure from public investors – particularly activist investors – to take board actions (or face the risk of being voted off the board) that the board believes are not in the best interest of the company and its stockholders and maximizing value over the long term.  Corporate defensive measures generally aren’t relevant when a company is private given the corporate structure with significant long-term investor representation on the board and various agreements in place with stockholders.  However, these measures become relevant once a company has public stockholders, so many companies who are considering an initial public offering will assess what types of defensive measures would be appropriate for them.\n\nA classified board is viewed as corporate defensive measure (i.e., it’s an anti-takeover and activist defense) as the entire board can’t be replaced in a single election cycle (with 3 classes, it would take up to the 3rd election cycle for the full board to be replaced, and generally 2 years to capture a majority).", "category": "general_qa"}

Each microphone technology was developed for a certain kind of environment.\n\nCondenser microphones like the Blue Yeti are designed to record their entire environment with the utmost clarity. If your environment is noisy then the microphone audio will be noisy. But if the environment has been acoustically treated then the recording will sound detailed and clear. \n\nDynamic microphones like the Shure SM7B are designed to record sounds spoken within a 18 inches of the front of the microphone. All other sounds will be quieter and less detailed. If the environment is noisy then the microphone audio will tend to mute out sound that comes from off-axis. If the environment is quiet then the audio will sound good, but only if the person or instrument being recorded is within 18 inches of the microphone.\n\nA ribbon microphone is designed to capture extremely loud percussion sounds, usually from drums or brass instruments.

Only in the realm of vocal composition – opera and the mass – was his effect on later generations muted.\n\nBeethoven's stylistic innovations bridge the Classical and Romantic periods. The works of his early period brought the Classical form to its highest expressive level, expanding in formal, structural, and harmonic terms the musical idiom developed by predecessors such as Mozart and Haydn. The works of his middle period were more forward-looking, contributing to the musical language and thinking of the Romantic era, inspiring composers such as Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, and Johannes Brahms. His late period works were characterized by formal, harmonic, and structural experimentation at the highest level, often pointing toward contrapuntal tendencies and microscopic textures, as well as an increasingly introverted compositional outlook. Though rightly credited as a major harbinger of the Romantic era in music that followed, Beethoven never abandoned the fundamental formal paradigms and generally objective artistic philosophy characterizing musical Classicism to the same extent that later composers such as Berlioz or even Schubert did.", "response": "- Heightened the symphonic form and had a dramatic influence on the piano sonata, violin sonata, string quartet, piano concertos and other genres\n- Contributed to the musical language and thinking of the romantic era\n- Formal, harmonic and structural experimentation in his later works", "category": "summarization"}

For example, TICA's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint variety of the Persian by the CFA, while the Javanese (or Colorpoint Longhair) is a color variation of the Balinese in both the TICA and the CFA; both breeds are merged (along with the Colorpoint Shorthair) into a single \"mega-breed\", the Colourpoint, by the World Cat Federation (WCF), who have repurposed the name \"Javanese\" for the Oriental Longhair. Also, \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to different breeds in other registries. There are many examples of nomenclatural overlap and differences of this sort. Furthermore, many geographical and cultural names for cat breeds are fanciful selections made by Western breeders to be exotic sounding and bear no relationship to the actual origin of the breeds;[6] the Balinese, Javanese, and Himalayan are all examples of this trend.\n\nThe domestic short-haired and domestic long-haired cat types are not breeds, but terms used (with various spellings) in the cat fancy to describe \"mongrel\" or \"bicolor\" cats by coat length, ones that do not belong to a particular breed. Some registries permit them to be pedigreed and they have been used as foundation stock in the establishment of some breeds.[citation needed] They should not be confused with standardized breeds with similar names, such as the British Shorthair and Oriental Longhair.", "response": "Base on the examples taken from the text, give me the total # of The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes standardized breeds", "category": "summarization"}

The term Bronze Age is used to describe the period that followed the Stone Age, as well as to describe cultures that had developed techniques and technologies for working copper alloys (bronze: originally copper and arsenic, later copper and tin) into tools, supplanting stone in many uses.\n\nStone Age artifacts that have been discovered include tools used by modern humans, by their predecessor species in the genus Homo, and possibly by the earlier partly contemporaneous genera Australopithecus and Paranthropus.

{"instruction": "How should I select a tennis racket if I'm completely new to the sport?", "context": "", "response": "If you're a beginner tennis player, you should pick a racket that will help you learn the game quickly. There are a few key factors to consider. The first factor is grip size. There are several ways to measure grip size, but the simplest is to hold the grip and ensure there is about a finger's width remaining between your ring finger and base of your thumb when you hold the racket. Too small a grip may lead to squeezing the racket too hard, and too large a grip will make the racket unwieldy. The second factor is the weight of the racket. A racket in the range of 250 to 310 grams (unstrung) will be suitable for most players. A beginner male player might shoot for something in the 280-305 gram range, and a beginner female might use a racket in the 275-300 gram range. Junior players (age 10+), depending on age and size, should consider rackets in the 250 to 300 gram range. The third factor is the racket head size. You should look for a 100-105 square inch head size. These days even professionals use 100 sq inch commonly, and 95 is considered small (for advanced players). The racket composition is not a key differentiator, as most rackets are made of some sort of graphite composite material. Price is also not an indication of quality. Pricier rackets might be less suited to beginners, in fact. As to brand, it's a very personal choice. I would say choose a brand that you associate with wanting to play (perhaps you're a fan of a player who is sponsored by that brand). You can certainly find rackets at many big box retailers that would check all these boxes. And if you're not sure -- many online as well as local racket retailers run \"demo\" programs allowing you to try different rackets. Choose one that helps you consistently make contact with the ball and get it over the net. The most important thing is to get out on the court and play!", "category": "open_qa"}

{"instruction": "Give me a concise summary of the history of baseball", "context": "The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland.[42][43][44] American baseball historian David Block suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and \"tut-ball\".[42] The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery.[45] Block discovered that the first recorded game of \"Bass-Ball\" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.[46] This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants.[47]\n\nBy the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America.[48] The first officially recorded baseball game in North America was played in Beachville, Ontario, Canada, on June 4, 1838.[49] In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules,[50] which in turn were based on rules developed in 1837 by William R. Wheaton of the Gotham Club.[51] While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the \"New York Nine\" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings.[52] With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.[53] By the time of the Civil War, baseball had begun to overtake its fellow bat-and-ball sport cricket in popularity within the United States, due in part to baseball being of a much shorter duration than the form of cricket played at the time, as well as the fact that troops during the Civil War did not need a specialized playing surface to play baseball, as they would have required for cricket.", "response": "Although the history of baseball cannot be determined with great precision, it is said that the game originated in England during the 1700s. The first official game to be played in North America took place in 1838 in Beachville, Ontario, Canada and in 1846 the first official game took place in the United States. The original rules of baseball, called the Knickerbocker Rules\" were established in 1845 and formed the basis of the rules of modern baseball that evolved over the following century.", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "What hikes in the White Mountains are the most dangerous?", "context": "", "response": "The degree of danger associated with any hike is subjective based on the hiker's general hiking experience, physical fitness, safety training and familiarity with the trails and terrain in the region. Many hikes are considered dangerous due to their steep pitches and exposure to the elements, while others can be considered dangerous due to less activity and poor trail blazing, such as bushwhacks. Other factors such as inclement weather can dramatically increase the danger of even a moderate hike. Proper preparedness, familiarity of the trails, understanding of incoming weather patterns and communicating your plans and timing to another person helps reduce risk in hiking the White Mountains, but one always assumes some degree of risk. A simple sprained ankle can mean life or death in bad weather, as the White Mountains, and notably the Presidential Range and Mount Washington, are notorious for life-threatening weather. Combined with very exposed routes and lack of safety equipment, even the most experienced hikers have fallen victim to the White Mountains. For experienced hikers seeking more adventurous routes, one might refer to the popular list \"The  Terrifying 25\" which provides a list of routes that have steep inclines, a lot of exposure, fun ladders and caves, among other features. Huntington Ravine on Mount Washington is considered the most dangerous in all the Whites for its erratic weather, steep, exposed trails with drop-offs, and less traveled by other hikers.", "category": "general_qa"}

During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency‍—‌that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted‍—‌but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.", "response": "During financial crises in early 20th century, some banks refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks, which ultimately led to severe crises that swept the nation, therefore Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system to address such systematic issues.", "category": "information_extraction"}

Next, they excavate, or dig, to find evidence of past habitations. This results in recovering material culture, or artifacts. The artifacts are then taken to a laboratory where they are analyzed. This analysis including cleaning the artifacts, determining dates and functions, and entering those artifacts into a database where further statistical analysis may be performed. Once all this data is gathered and analyzed, archaeologist need to interpret what they have found. This data can tell you when a site was occupied, who lived there, what they were eating, and what time of year a site was occupied. Once the archaeologists have interpreted the data the write a report detailing the work that was done and their interpretation of the site.

{"instruction": "What is an enzyme inhibitor?", "context": "", "response": "An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that binds to an enzyme's active site, or another site on the enzyme, and blocks the enzyme's catalysis of the reaction. Enzyme inhibitors are generally specific to one enzyme and control that enzyme's activity. They also control essential enzymes such as proteases or nucleases that, if left unchecked, may damage a cell. \n\nMany poisons produced by animals or plants are enzyme inhibitors, and many drug molecules are enzyme inhibitors that inhibit an aberrant human enzyme or an enzyme critical for the survival of a pathogen. Since anti-pathogen inhibitors generally target only one enzyme, such drugs are highly specific and generally produce few side effects in humans. \n\nMedicinal enzyme inhibitors often have low dissociation constants, meaning a minute amount of the inhibitor will inhibit the enzyme. The discovery of enzyme inhibitors and their refinement are researched in biochemistry and pharmacology.", "category": "general_qa"}

There are strict classification systems enforced by competitive motorcycle sport sanctioning bodies, or legal definitions of a motorcycle established by certain legal jurisdictions for motorcycle registration, emissions, road traffic safety rules or motorcyclist licensing. There are also informal classifications or nicknames used by manufacturers, riders, and the motorcycling media. Some experts do not recognize sub-types, like naked bike, that \"purport to be classified\" outside the six usual classes, because they fit within one of the main types and are recognizable only by cosmetic changes.[9]\n\nStreet motorcycles are motorcycles designed for being ridden on paved roads. They have smooth tires with tread patterns and engines generally in the 125 cc (7.6 cu in) and over range. Typically, street motorcycles are capable of speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h), and many of speeds in excess of 125 mph (201 km/h).

{"instruction": "What makes a good cocktail?", "context": "", "response": "There are many elements to a good cocktail, and these can often be modified to fit individual tastes. In general, a cocktail contains a base spirit, flavors from bitters or amaros, and something to sweeten. There are optional ingredients to add as well, like fruit, juice, or herbs. \n\nThe amount of each ingredient can vary the flavor significantly, so it is important to understand the impact of each ingredient. For example, very strong flavors like bitters or absinthe should be used in very small quantities. Sometimes even a rinse in the cocktail glass or spritz on the top of the prepared cocktail is enough to add the desired amount of flavor.\n\nA good cocktail comes about from a balance in flavors that build and develop off one another. The deep wooden flavor in whiskey is brightened by the citrus twist of an old fashioned. The sweetness from pineapple juice is deepened by the bitterness of campari in a jungle bird. The bitterness of ginger syrup is balanced with the tartness of lemon juice in a penicillin. \n\nMany newer cocktails are spins off a classic. Each builds off a flavor profile and modifies some of the more subtle flavors therein. If one wants to experiment with creating a new cocktail, starting with a classic favorite could be a good place to start. \n\nIt is also possible to create the same balanced flavors without the use of spirits (or with the use of alcohol free spirits).", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "What is fractional-reserve banking?", "context": "", "response": "Fractional-reserve banking is the system of banking operating in almost all countries worldwide, under which banks that take deposits from the public are required to hold a proportion of their deposit liabilities in liquid assets as a reserve, and are at liberty to lend the remainder to borrowers. Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the \"reserve requirement\" or \"reserve ratio\". Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves.\n\nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be \"at call\", while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks may find themselves in a shortfall situation when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus. In exceptional situations, such as during an unexpected bank run, the central bank may provide funds to cover the short-term shortfall as lender of last resort.", "category": "open_qa"}

{"instruction": "What is epistatis?", "context": "", "response": "Epistasis is a phenomenon in genetics in which the effect of a gene mutation is dependent on the presence or absence of mutations in one or more other genes, respectively termed modifier genes. In other words, the effect of the mutation is dependent on the genetic background in which it appears. Epistatic mutations therefore have different effects on their own than when they occur together. Originally, the term epistasis specifically meant that the effect of a gene variant is masked by that of a different gene.\n\nThe concept of epistasis originated in genetics in 1907 but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. The phenomenon arises due to interactions, either between genes (such as mutations also being needed in regulators of gene expression) or within them (multiple mutations being needed before the gene loses function), leading to non-linear effects. Epistasis has a great influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and for the evolvability of phenotypic traits.", "category": "open_qa"}

As you are hitting a bump, you want to keep your back as straight as possible and let your hip and knee take the impact. The movement pattern is similar to squatting down, where you want to drop your bottom down towards your ankle. The reason you want your knee and hip to take the impact is because those joints have much bigger range of motion compared to your back so as you hit a bump or mogul, those joints will help absorb the majority of the irregularity in the terrain so your back is not needing to move as much which will help reduce the strain being put on it.", "category": "creative_writing"}

The process was completed in the 13th century when the Principality of Wales became a client state of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, Magna Carta began the process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. In the 16th century, English and Scottish monarchs played a central role in what became the religious English Reformation and Scottish Reformation. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a single sovereign. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England, which followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Following the installation of William III and Mary II as co-monarchs in the Glorious Revolution, the Bill of Rights 1689, and its Scottish counterpart the Claim of Right Act 1689, further curtailed the power of the monarchy and excluded Roman Catholics from succession to the throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

To that end, we need LASER to generate outputs that would not target racial groups – African American communities, for example – and in turn aggravate the pre-existing police harassment in those regions. Yet, there exists no possible source of data inputs for LASER to achieve such goal. The algorithm has been historically accused of racial profiling despite not using race as a predictor for criminal tendencies. However, our society is fraught with deep-rooted racism such that data points themselves bear the mark of discriminatory ideology and practices. For instance, gang membership as a predictor in LASER essentially serves as a proxy for race. Gangs in African American communities arose as a result of economic deprivation, resource insufficiency, as well as police harassment – phenomena with roots that can be  easily traced back to age-old racial segregation. Similarly, criminal records hold the vestiges of the New Jim Crow. Therefore, using gang activity and past arrests as predictors in the LASER system only generate outputs with heavy racial connotations, which in turn reinforce and reify historical biases.\n\nNotwithstanding the problematic algorithm, we do not need to cast away the system entirely. When LASER points to places of deep-rooted discrimination and deprivation, we should mend but not aggravate. Instead of composing chronic offender bulletins, we can treat the LASER outputs as agenda for our next social welfare and infrastructure construction projects – where do we need to build more schools and hospitals? Where should the money go to create more job opportunities? Where do we need to address the problem of police misconduct and rebuild the relationship between people and law enforcement? If we cannot fix a “bias in, bias out” algorithm, we can at least attend to the information it has generated and figure out where the biases have wreaked havoc and taken a heavy toll. We can then redistribute resources and fundings accordingly so that the historically deprived neighborhoods have the chance to flourish. In doing so, we can achieve both sustainability and equity. We can expect the crime rates to go down when the neighborhood achieves economic growth and employment, and such crime reduction is sustainable, unlike the original LASER system that continues to discriminate and deprive.", "category": "creative_writing"}

{"instruction": "What are the benefits of Microservices?", "context": "", "response": "Microservices break up Monolithic Architecture into standalone lightweight services that serve a single purpose.  Developer productivity is increased as teams dedicated to the single responsibility service can control releases independent of other services.  They can also control the language the service is written in.  This is helpful when certain services might benefit from being written in Python vs C#, Java or Javascript.  Microservices advocate for an event driven architecture where services are not coupled or referenced directly.  Each Microservice can publish events that can be consumed/subscribed by other services.  Containerization and Microservices go well together when designing Microservices, considering that the paradigm calls for Containers to be immutable and treated as Cattle.  New and Old versions of the same Microservice can be released side by side in an A/B pattern, helping with assurance of any updates.  Containers can host the Microservices quickly and be tested across environments with reliability ensuring all dependencies are encapsulated in the build of the running image.", "category": "open_qa"}
