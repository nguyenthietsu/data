{"instruction": "Why did Christopher Columbus think he had sailed to Asia instead of America? What maps did he have at his disposal?", "context": "", "response": "The reason behind Columbus' belief that he had reached Asia is depicted on a map of the Atlantic Ocean from 1474, created by Florentine mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli. This map was later included in a literary and historical atlas of America by Bartholomew in 1884, with light blue areas marking regions that were not originally present on the map.\n\nToscanelli served as an inspiration for Columbus, who received a letter from him on June 25, 1474. The letter was sent to canon Fernam Martins in Lisbon, who consulted Toscanelli on behalf of King Alfonso V about the possibility of reaching India through a western route.\n\nThe map clearly shows that Columbus was both inspired and misguided by Toscanelli's plan, which underestimated the Earth's circumference. This miscalculation led Columbus to believe that he had reached Japan instead of a completely new and unfamiliar continent lying between Europe and Asia.\n\nToscanelli's proposed plan involved sailing west along the equator to reach India and the wealthy countries of East Asia. The map that Toscanelli enclosed, which is now lost, included the western fringes of Europe and Africa, as well as the eastern fringes of Asia, with the Atlantic Ocean in between. However, Toscanelli mistakenly believed that the distance was only one-third of the Earth's circumference, far less than the actual distance.\n\nIn a letter, Toscanelli writes, among other things:\n\nI have already spoken once before of a route across the sea to the land of spices, much shorter than that of the Portuguese across Guinea. That is why His Highness the King is now asking me for information on this subject, or rather for an explanation so clear that even people without any scientific background can understand that this path must exist. Although I know that it has its basis in the spherical shape of the earth, I have nevertheless, in order to make myself better understood and facilitate the project, decided to prove that such a route exists by means of a specially constructed sea chart. I am therefore sending his highness a map drawn by myself, on which I have marked the coasts and islands which can be used as points of departure when one undertakes such a journey and on this journey keeps a steady westerly course", "category": "general_qa"}

Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.\n\nWestern music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\n\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not.

Research in the field of positive psychology has shown that simply being in/around nature can improve one's sense of well-being. Being able to exercise while feeling the sun on your back, hearing the birds chirp, and seeing people play around in the sand is a totally different experience than being stuck inside a dark building. Additionally, playing volleyball in the sand is way more difficult and a harder workout than playing on a court. In order to jump the same height or run after a shanked ball, you have to exert more energy. Since exercise is known to release endorphins, one could argue that more endorphins are released when playing beach volleyball over indoor.

{"instruction": "Is competition healthy?", "context": "", "response": "Competition is prevalent everywhere in our society. Despite causing many people to feel stressed or pressured, competition is beneficial for challenging oneself, but it must be utilized properly.\nA common habitat of competition is in sports. Whether it be competing against another person, another team, or against time, sports push people to work harder, faster, and stronger. This athletic competition is good, because it is mutually beneficial for both parties. Both and all players are challenged physically, and thats are taught both the importance and, if they succeed, the rewards of hard work.\nCompetition in sports is expected, However, the misuse of competitiveness has become common in academics. While competition in sports is expected, academics is meant to be more reflective. Competition between students for the highest marks can be good, as both will challenge each other, but often makes other students feel belittled and unworthy. Grades in particular are a measure of self-knowledge and hard work and should not be used to compare one student to another. This is where and how competition is often misused and its intentions misunderstood.\nOften this misused competition comes from pressure from peers, parents, and sometimes teachers. A common example is competition between siblings stimulated by parents: comparing the childrens looks, academie abilities, athleticism, and social awareness. This kind of abusive competition is more likely to create anxiety, insecurity, and depression for both siblings, revealing perhaps the most important condition for healthy competition: it has to come from yourself.\nAlmost all negative experiences with competition stem from society around us, leading many to believe that the correct thing to do is compare students, siblings. children, employees, and more. But competition's true purpose is to inspiles oneself to work hard and take on new challenges. \"Forced\" competition doesn't allow a person to be in control of their goals. This is why Kohn felt \"caught on a treadmill,\" when being compared to others. The competition comes from within and motivates one to set, work for, and reach new goals.\nTo prevent unhealthy competition, people should try to be more vocal about their goals and expectations about themselves. Encouragement, of course, is always nice so voicing your wishes is important. If parents, teachers, or bosses know what you expect from yourself. they can better encourage, support, and challenge you.", "category": "creative_writing"}

Topping your meals with high-protein nuts like almonds or pistachios is a clever and sneaky way of getting some extra protein in your food. If you still aren't getting enough protein in your diet, you can supplement with a protein shake. This is a great option for people that don't consume animal products, as many protein powders are plant-based.

In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.\n\nMolecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes.[6] In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.\n\nMolecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology.

I had found myself nestled under a pile of leaves and broken branches, just starting to sprout from an old rotting stump.  It was pretty warm.  As I peeked into the crisp new air, I saw ferns, spiders, and buzzing flies surrounding me.  But the thing that caught my attention most of all was the bright blue sky.  I wondered what was out there and if I would ever get to see it.  I had just met this world and wanted to learn so much more.  But I was only 3 inches tall and couldn't see much of anything.  So I waited.\n\nAs I got taller, the days began to feel shorter.  My favorite part of the day was feeling the wind blow through my newly acquired canopy of needles.  It wasn't much to look at, but I was proud.  I'd often stare at the giant trees around me.  How I yearned to be one of the tall redwoods.  They were kings of the forest; nothing stood taller.  I wanted to see what they could see from way up there.  One day I'll be one of them.\n\nDays turned to weeks, and weeks turned into years, and it all felt so rushed that I could hardly keep track of the changing world around me.  I had grown tall enough to see through a clearing in the upper canopy.  Beyond our patch of trees was a mountain of countless others.  Looking out into the endless distance, I began to feel small.  What a strange feeling.  One cloudy day, I saw a lightning bolt strike a hilltop.  Soon enough, bright orange flames erupted across the horizon.  What a peculiar sight.  What began as a curiosity soon became terror as the fire rushed closer to my area of the woods.  I could feel the warm wind on my face as the fire grew more prominent.  Mercifully, the dark clouds hanging overhead opened up to a torrential downpour.  Cold pelting raindrops replaced the warm breeze, night fell over the mountain, and the forest breathed a sigh of relief.  \n\nI awoke to a strange sight when the sun returned the next day.  What was once hundreds of proud redwoods was now a deep black scar on the mountain.  That would be me one day.", "category": "creative_writing"}

In recent years, there have been proponents and skeptics of multiverse theories within the physics community.

{"instruction": "Why is Citizen Kane considered the Best Film?", "context": "", "response": "The American Film Institute and the British Film Institute have Citizen Kane listed as the number one movie of all time.  The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography. Orson Welles would never have a similar level of success with his later films.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "How do you fry shrimp?", "context": "", "response": "Frying shrimp is very easy, and requires simple equipment and ingredients. \n\nUse shrimp that is U-15 or less.  Frying shrimp that are larger than U-15 will result in tough shrimp.  First, clean and devein the shrimp, and then set them aside.  \n\nThen, heat vegetable, canola or peanut oil to 375 degrees.  These oils have a high smoke point (this is the temperature at which the oil will burn and smoke), and are good choices generally for frying.   Use a cast iron pan if you have one, or another good quality pan that retains heat evenly and well.  \n\nWhile the oil is heating, prep the flour. The crispness of the shrimp will depend on the type of flour that you use.  All purpose flour is readily available, and results in a nice, crispy shrimp.  Using rice flour will result in even more crispy shrimp, although rice flour is available at Asian grocery stores and is not readily available at general grocery stores. Using corn starch will result in the crispiest shrimp.  For one pound of shrimp, use 2 cups of whatever type of flour (or cornstarch) that you would prefer, and season the flour liberally with salt and pepper, and add some red pepper flakes if you prefer a little bit of spice.  \n\nAt this point, dry the shrimp and dredge the shrimp in the flour in relatively small batches.  Set aside until the oil is ready.\n\nOnce the oil is at 375 degrees, put a few shrimp in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Too many shrimp in the oil will result in less crispy shrimp, as well as shrimp that is oily.  You should use your judgment on how many shrimp to add, depending on the size of the shrimp and the size of the pan.  The shrimp will take only a few minutes in the oil to be done, again depending on the size of the shrimp.  The shrimp will be done once it’s no longer translucent.  For shrimp that is 21/25 count or larger, using a spider (which is a type of skimmer) will make it easier to get the shrimp out of the pan.  Promptly after the shrimp is out of the pan, sprinkle salt on the shrimp and serve.", "category": "general_qa"}
{"instruction": "Based on the reference text, how did the United States implement separation of powers?", "context": "Separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws, in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches, each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others. This philosophy heavily influenced the drafting of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. The American form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as Montesquieu advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States, such as Alexander Hamilton, who participated in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 which drafted the Constitution.\n\nSome U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The president of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as vice presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers.

By a treaty with William Penn in 1726, various tribes either rented or gave up their land on both sides of Brandywine Creek. Nemacolin likely grew up near Shamokin, Pennsylvania, a village near the Susquehanna River to which the Delaware had retreated when faced with disease and colonization of their traditional lands by white settlers. His family grew to know trader Thomas Cresap, and moved south and west with the Cresap family, likely after a controversy between groups of settlers aligned with the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania known as Cresap's War.[1]\n\nCirca 1750, Cresap received instructions to improve the Native American path across the Appalachian Mountains through the Cumberland Narrows. He hired Nemacolin and his two sons, among others, to complete the task between Will's Creek (a trading post on a tributary of the Potomac River later the site of Fort Cumberland) and the mouth of Redstone Creek on the Monongahela River (a tributary of the Ohio River) which later became Redstone Old Fort and even later Brownsville, Pennsylvania.[2] A side trail led to the residence of Christopher Gist. Gist led George Washington along Nemacolin's Path in 1753 and 1754. It was later improved to permit supply wagons for General Edward Braddock's army, and the General ultimately died on the route in 1755 after the disastrous Battle of the Monongahela near present day Pittsburgh.

His films are marked by melodrama, irreverent humour, bold colour, glossy décor, quotations from popular culture, and complex narratives. Desire, passion, family, and identity are among Almodóvar's most prevalent subjects in his films. Acclaimed as one of the most internationally successful Spanish filmmakers, Almodóvar and his films have gained worldwide interest and developed a cult following.\n\nAlmodóvar's career came to during La Movida Madrileña, a cultural renaissance that followed after the end of Francoist Spain. His early films characterised the sense of sexual and political freedom of the period. In 1986, he established his own film production company, El Deseo, with his younger brother Agustín Almodóvar, who has been responsible for producing all of his films since Law of Desire (1987). His breakthrough film was Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nHe achieved further success often collaborating with actors Antonio Banderas and Penélope Cruz. He directed Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1989), High Heels (1991), and Live Flesh (1997).

This region is mostly desert, a landscape and ecosystem that is unusually vulnerable to degradation. Without the concerted efforts of an administration that can apply consistent regulation and stewardship of these lands across a broad territory that crosses state boundaries, the value of these lands to local residents would decline even further, becoming less productive and less attractive to the hunters, fishermen, and other tourists whose spending represents the majority of income for many of these Intermountain communities.", "category": "creative_writing"}

{"instruction": "When did space exploration begin ?", "context": "Space exploration stared during the late 1920s leading to the first crewed rocket cars and rocket planes, then there was the US and Soviet activities from 1950 onwards", "response": "The world's first large-scale experimental rocket program was Opel-RAK under the leadership of Fritz von Opel and Max Valier during the late 1920s leading to the first crewed rocket cars and rocket planes,[2][3] which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities from 1950 onwards. The Opel-RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air vehicles drew large crowds, as well as caused global public excitement as so-called \"Rocket Rumble\"[4] and had a large long-lasting impact on later spaceflight pioneers like Wernher von Braun. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.[5] The early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nWith the substantial completion of the ISS[6] following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020[7] was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009.[8] The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth–Moon L1, the Moon, Earth–Sun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.[9]", "category": "information_extraction"}

Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011. Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state; industry and business were nationalized, and socialist reforms were implemented throughout society.\n\nBorn in Birán, the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist and anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro travelled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's prime minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic embargo, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961.

When you are stretching, you are elongating the muscles. If you bounce while stretching, you can activate your tendon’s stretch reflex, causing your muscle to try and contract while also elongating it, which may tear the muscle or even detach the tendon from the bone in extreme cases.

Of these three it is true rhythm is the easiest for computers to do a near perfect job of imitating.  Advancements in technology from the first drum machines that appeared in the 1970s, to widely used beat machines of the 1990's, to software music composition suites of today means you now have a lot of control at youf finger tips to create rhythm. You can now create drum beats that account for tempo variations, pitch variations, changes in dynamics, how close the drum pattern stays on beat, the type of hit the beat should be using, what the tension on the drum heads should sound like, how much rebound against the drum head is present, velocity of the stick, the simulated room size of where the drum kit is located,  how much resonance is vibrating in the drum kit itself, tonal variance of the wood shells used to create the drum beat and many more.   These advancements make software drumbeats realistic, and indistinguishable from their human counterparts yet the role of the drummer in modern music could not be more important.  Humans love live music, and very few commercially successful live musical acts do not use a live drummer.  Even rap and hip hop--two musical genres famous for ushering in the area of \"sampled\" drum beats, and \"sampled song loops\"-- often will have a live drummer on stage despite the ease of which the music can be broadcast loudly without requiring one.   The reason is simple: live drums and the musicians who perform using them are both visually and sonically exciting.  There are genres where a drummer is not provided such as \"DJ Couture\" and \"Electronic Dance music\" (or EDM) but they are the exceptions and not the rule. From the earliest humans banging rocks and sticks together, to the modern drums of today the future of the live drummer in music has never been brighter.", "category": "general_qa"}

Their numbers have dwindled from a high of some 40,000 in the 1960s. The main reason is emigration to Greece after the end of the Cold War when laws allowed the return of all ethnic Greeks who had been exiled for political reasons after the Greek Civil War. The biggest Greek community in the country is in the capital city of Tashkent where most of the Greek political refugees were relocated by the Soviet authorities.[1] In ancient times the south of the country was part of the Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom but the few Greek communities there have since assimilated.

With the conversion to metric measures, the milk industry was concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500 mL bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption; hence, all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600 mL bottles. With time, due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting, transporting, storing and cleaning glass bottles, they were replaced by cardboard cartons.

In April, he was visited by the American artist Dodge MacKnight, who was living nearby at Fontvieille.[127][128] On 1 May 1888, for 15 francs per month, he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the Yellow House at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.[129]\nOn 7 May, Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare,[130] having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and Marie Ginoux. The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio.[131] He wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included Van Gogh's Chair (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Night Café (1888), Café Terrace at Night (September 1888), Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888), and Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (1888), all intended for the decoration for the Yellow House.[132]\nVan Gogh wrote that with The Night Café he tried \"to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime\".[133] When he visited Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant – Paul-Eugène Milliet[134] – and painted boats on the sea and the village.[135] MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to Eugène Boch, a Belgian painter who sometimes stayed in Fontvieille, and the two exchanged visits in July.[134]", "response": "Some famous paintings of Vincent van Gogh include Van Gogh's Chair (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Night Café (1888), Café Terrace at Night (September 1888), Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888), and Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (1888).", "category": "information_extraction"}

Everywhere she had gone, a ripple of colors seemed to have formed. The fungi had reacted to her presence, and sent signals to the other fungi in the area, where the signal had been propagated.

There are few ways to do it but the easiest one for the home is to pre-ferment a small portion of equal amounts of water and flour.\n\nFor example, start with separating out the total ingredients: 1000g flour, 650g water, 30g salt, 5g dry yeast. This will result in 1680g of dough enough for ~8 medium pizzas. Mix 200g of water, flour and the yeast and let it sit on counter for an hour. Then move to the refrigerator for slow fermentation for ~24h. Take this out and add the remaining ingredients. Kneed until smooth, and let it rest on the counter for 1h. Cover with olive oil to avoid drying out. Cut balls and place in a tray. Lightly cover with olive oil again and cling film. After 1-2h the balls double in size and will be ready for some amazing pizza.", "category": "general_qa"}

His great grandfather Krishnakanta Bandyopadhyay was a Rarhi Kulin (noble) Brahmin. Among Kulin Brahmins – descendants of the six families of Brahmins imported from Kannauj by Ballal Sen in the 12th century – those from the Rarhi district of West Bengal were notorious in the 19th century for living off dowries by marrying several women. Kulinism was a synonym for polygamy and the dowry system, both of which Rammohan campaigned against.[6] His father, Ramkanta, was a Vaishnavite, while his mother, Tarini Devi, was from a Shaivite family. He was a great scholar of Sanskrit, Persian and English languages and also knew Arabic, Latin and Greek. One parent prepared him for the occupation of a scholar, the Shastri, while the other secured for him all the worldly advantages needed to launch a career in the laukik or worldly sphere of public administration.[citation needed] Torn between these two parental ideals from early childhood, Ram Mohan vacillated between the two for the rest of his life.[7]During his childhood Ram Mohan Roy witnessed death of his sister in law through sati. The seventeen year old girl was dragged towards the pyre where Ram Mohan Roy witnessed her terrified state. He tried to protest but to no avail. She was burned alive. The people chanted \"Maha Sati! Maha Sati! Maha Sati!\" (great wife) over her painful screams. [8]", "response": "Sanskrit, Persian, English, Arabic, Latin and Greek.", "category": "information_extraction"}

The union did not want the slave stares to secede.

The slave states were based on a plantation system and the only fast growth was in texas. These states were largely rural with few large cities and little industry except in close proximity to free states.", "category": "open_qa"}
{"instruction": "From the passage provided, extract the gravitational constant on Earth. Include the units of measurements.", "context": "In SI units this acceleration is expressed in metres per second squared (in symbols, m/s2 or m·s−2) or equivalently in newtons per kilogram (N/kg or N·kg−1). Near Earth's surface, the gravity acceleration is approximately 9.81 m/s2 (32.2 ft/s2), which means that, ignoring the effects of air resistance, the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.81 metres (32.2 ft) per second every second. This quantity is sometimes referred to informally as little g (in contrast, the gravitational constant G is referred to as big G).\n\nThe precise strength of Earth's gravity varies depending on the location. The nominal \"average\" value at Earth's surface, known as standard gravity is, by definition, 9.80665 m/s2 (32.1740 ft/s2).[4] This quantity is denoted variously as gn, ge (though this sometimes means the normal equatorial value on Earth, 9.78033 m/s2 (32.0877 ft/s2)), g0, gee, or simply g (which is also used for the variable local value).\n\nThe weight of an object on Earth's surface is the downwards force on that object, given by Newton's second law of motion, or F = m a (force = mass × acceleration). Gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration, but other factors, such as the rotation of Earth, also contribute, and, therefore, affect the weight of the object. Gravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, which are accounted for in terms of tidal effects.", "response": "9.80665 m/s2 or 32.1740 ft/s2", "category": "information_extraction"}

When it was within a couple miles of us, my wife took the dogs and blankets and went to our safe place - an internal bathroom. I stood back from the windows and watched the tv. From my position, I could see out the back windows which faced west - southwest. The weather showed that the tornado was right on top of us. I watched out the window as a fragment of a four by four, about a foot and a half long, flipped up from the ground and tumbled across the lawn. \n\nIt was that moment that I decided I had watched enough and stepped into the bathroom to join my wife and the dogs. The storm blew over us.

{"instruction": "What is John Ellis water and the bond angle of water?", "context": "", "response": "Traditional tap and purified water has a hydrogen bond angle of 104 - 104.5 degrees.  John Ellis water takes standard tap or purified water and changes the hydrogen bond angle of it from 104 degrees to 113 - 114 degrees.  Changing the bond angle is done using multi-pass distillation by rapidly heating and cooling the water inside the boiling chamber.\n\nWater consumed with a bond angle above 108° degrees eliminates the effect of potential pathogens in our food supply (e.g. bacterium, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) from affecting our bodies because more oxygen from the water mixes with the superior blood flow to all the extremities of our body.

Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with the other member firms in the network to share a common name, brand, intellectual property, and quality standards. Each network has established a global entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network.\n\nUntil 2020, KPMG[3] was the only Big Four firm not registered as a UK private company, but rather the co-ordinating entity was a Swiss association (verein). However, KPMG International changed its legal structure from a verein to a co-operative under Swiss law in 2003,[4] then to a UK limited company in 2020.[3] For Deloitte,[5] PricewaterhouseCoopers[6] and Ernst & Young,[7] the co-ordinating entity is a UK limited company. Those entities do not themselves perform external professional services, nor do they own or control the member firms. Nevertheless, these networks colloquially are referred to as \"firms\" for the sake of simplicity and to reduce confusion with lay-people. These accounting and professional services networks are similar in nature to how law firm networks in the legal profession work.\n\nIn many cases, each member firm practices in a single country, and is structured to comply with the regulatory environment in that country.\n\nErnst & Young also includes separate legal entities which manage three of its four geographic areas: the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and EMEIA (Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa) groups, the fourth area being Japan, which has no larger co-ordination branch. These entities coordinate services performed by local firms within their respective areas, but do not perform services or hold ownership in the local entities.[8] There are rare exceptions to this convention; in 2007, KPMG announced a merger of four internationally distinct member firms (in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) to form a single firm, KPMG Europe LLP.[9]", "response": "The Big Four refers to the the four largest professional services networks in the world.

Once his flight training in New Zealand was completed, he proceeded to the United Kingdom to serve with the Royal Air Force. He was posted to No. 485 Squadron in early 1942 but was shot down later in the year over Germany-occupied France. With the help of the French Resistance he avoided the Germans and made his way to the south of France. He was caught when crossing the border into Vichy France and was interned for several weeks. He escaped captivity and eventually back to the United Kingdom. He was transferred to the Middle East where he ferried aircraft before being posted to No. 93 Squadron. He flew Supermarine Spitfires in the Tunisian campaign and in the Allied invasion of Sicily, shooting down a number of German aircraft before being rested in December 1943. After a spell on instructing duties he returned to operational flying with No. 485 Squadron during the final stages of the war in Europe. He briefly commanded the squadron before it was disbanded in August 1945.\n\nReturning to civilian life after the war, he returned to his university studies, becoming a chemist.

According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. However, according to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.\n\nIn popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North. In Delhi, the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine.

Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, and then recruited Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified Diamond by the RIAA and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.[1]\n\nCharacterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, In Utero (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. The live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.\n\nNirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. During their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. They achieved five number-one hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200.

{"instruction": "Why is MPPT necessary?", "context": "Maximum power point tracking (MPPT)[1][2] or sometimes just power point tracking (PPT),[3][4] is a technique used with variable power sources to maximize energy extraction as conditions vary. The technique is most commonly used with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, but can also be used with wind turbines, optical power transmission and thermophotovoltaics.\n\nPV solar systems have varying relationships to inverter systems, external grids, battery banks, and other electrical loads.[5] The central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on the amount of available sunlight, shading, solar panel temperature and the load's electrical characteristics. As these conditions vary, the load characteristic (impedance) that gives the highest power transfer changes. The system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep power transfer at highest efficiency. This optimal load characteristic is called the maximum power point (MPP). MPPT is the process of adjusting the load characteristic as the conditions change. Circuits can be designed to present optimal loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems.\n\nSolar cells' non-linear relationship between temperature and total resistance can be analyzed based on the Current-voltage (I-V) curve and the power-voltage (P-V) curves.[6][7] MPPT samples cell output and applies the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power.[8] MPPT devices are typically integrated into an electric power converter system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors. Solar inverters convert DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT.\n\nThe power at the MPP (Pmpp) is the product of the MPP voltage (Vmpp) and MPP current (Impp).\n\nIn general, the P-V curve of a partially shaded solar array can have multiple peaks, and some algorithms can get stuck in a local maximum rather than the global maximum of the curve.[9]", "response": "The efficiency of transferring the power from the photovoltaic (PV) solar systems depends on many factors which change frequently. MPPT system purpose is to continuously adjust the parameters under which the system work to achieve the most efficient transfer of power from the solar system to the load.", "category": "information_extraction"}

{"instruction": "What are the most common causes of avalanches, in descending order of likelihood (where most likely is first)?", "context": "Most avalanches occur spontaneously during storms under increased load due to snowfall and/or erosion. The second largest cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, rockfall and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Contrary to popular belief, avalanches are not triggered by loud sound; the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche.[3]\n\nAvalanche initiation can start at a point with only a small amount of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic metres, can start moving almost simultaneously.\n\nA snowpack will fail when the load exceeds the strength. The load is straightforward; it is the weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely heterogeneous. It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains.[4] These properties may all metamorphose in time according to the local humidity, water vapour flux, temperature and heat flux. The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time.[5] A complicating factor is the complex interaction of terrain and weather, which causes significant spatial and temporal variability of the depths, crystal forms, and layering of the seasonal snowpack.", "response": "The most likely causes of avalanches, in order of likelihood, are:\n- Increased snow loads during storms\n- Erosion in the snowpack caused by storms\n- Metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to weather or rain\n- Earthquakes that trigger shifting in the snowpack\n- Falling objects, such as rockfall and snowfall, can trigger avalanches\n- Human triggers, such as skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosives.", "category": "information_extraction"}
