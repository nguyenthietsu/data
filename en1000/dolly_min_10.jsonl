So much of rock climbing revolves around your ability to hold on to very tiny or oddly shaped grips to keep you on the wall. Few other sports emphasize finger strength the way rock climbing does. Yet, like all other muscles in your body, finger strength is an element that can be developed over time.\n\nWith the right balance of both general athletics, body control, and finger strength you can become a great rock climber.", "category": "general_qa"}
