However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.", "req": "A prime number is a number greater than one that cannot be the product of two smaller numbers besides 1 and itself (e.g., the number 5 is prime because the only product of two smaller numbers is 5 and 1).", "cgr": "smz"}
