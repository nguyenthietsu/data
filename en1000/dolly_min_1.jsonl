{"instruction": "Who says Pi is Wrong?", "context": "", "response": "In the early 21st century, Bob Palais (a mathematician) and Michael Hartl (a physicist) declared that Pi, the traditional circle constant, was wrong.  Their argument is that Pi, defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is not the most effective or clear way to describe the geometry of a circle.\n\nPalais and Hartl contend that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius is a more useful constant.  They chose to name this new constant Tau.  Arithmetically, Tau = 2*Pi.\n\nThey argued that Tau produces cleaner mathematical equations throughout physics, mathematics, and statistics and, further, that it makes it easier to teach trigonometry and analytic geometry to new learners.", "category": "general_qa"}

Much like a picture frame. Depending on the detail of the artwork, the screens can have different size weave. The weave is essentially how tight the screen is woven and how large the holes in the screen are. For more detailed designs, the screen used will be woven very close and tight so the holes are very small and let less ink through. This allows for very thin lines and detail. Each screen can print 1 color at a time. So, to print a design with multiple colors, there needs to be multiple screens. 1 screen per color. Many screen printing presses have large rotating arms that hold the screens. The arms rotate for each color to be printed individually.", "category": "open_qa"}
