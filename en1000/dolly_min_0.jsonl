Generally, longer wavelengths (red) undergo a smaller deviation than shorter wavelengths (blue). The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.", "req": "A dispersive prism is an optical prism that disperses the light's different wavelengths at different angles.
