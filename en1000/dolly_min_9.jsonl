Most professional chefs will choose Kosher salt over table salt as they prefer the texture and usability.  Table salt, being very fine-grained, is more dense than kosher salt and as such, recipes using salt should be weighed rather than using a volume measurement to ensure that a different type of salt doesn’t ruin the recipe.", "cgr": "gqa"}

Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational.
