Auto-rotation is the decoupling of the rotor system from the engines to allow upward air flow to drive the rotor system at a faster than normal rate, providing kinetic energy that can be traded to arrest the helicopter's rate of descent.  To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing.", "cgr": "gqa"}

A connector can be configured to read data from a source system and write it to Kafka or to read data from Kafka and write it to a target system. There are a number of pre-built connectors available for common data sources such as databases, file systems, and message queues, as well as for cloud services such as AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

The rule considers the federal funds rate, the price level and changes in real income. The Taylor rule computes the optimal federal funds rate based on the gap between the desired (targeted) inflation rate and the actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural output level. According to Taylor, monetary policy is stabilizing when the nominal interest rate is higher/lower than the increase/decrease in inflation. Thus the Taylor rule prescribes a relatively high interest rate when actual inflation is higher than the inflation target.", "cgr": "oqa"}

Inshore fishing requires a smaller draft.  Draft is how much water a boat needs to float.  Offshore fishing boats have deeper drafts based on the hull.  Offshore boats can handle rougher water based on more aggressive hulls.  Offshore boats have steeper dead rise.  Dead rise is the angle of entry for the boat hull.
