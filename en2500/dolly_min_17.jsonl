Recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the Wonders of the Modern World, the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California.\n\nThe idea of a fixed link between San Francisco and Marin had gained increasing popularity during the late 19th century, but it was not until the early 20th century that such a link became feasible.

{"instruction": "What is \"strokes gained\" in golf?", "context": "", "response": "Strokes gained is a method of measuring a golfer's performance that revolutionized how people think about golf strategy and how they compare the performance of golfers.  \n\nSimply put, strokes gained measures how many strokes a player gains on every shot they hit in a round of golf.  \n\nFor example, if a player stands on the tee of a par 4 that is 375 yards long, their expected score for the hole for their skill level would be 4.0 strokes.  Assume they hit a strong drive of 275 yards, and land in the fairway.  Now their expected score for the hole might be 3.8.  Since their expected score went from 4.0 to 3.8 as a result of the drive, they gained .2 strokes with the drive.\n\nIf you repeat this for every shot in a round of golf, you would gain a picture of strokes gained for the overall round.\n\nOne key to strokes gained is what an expected score is for each hole.  This was first calculated for tour pro players when shot by shot stats were available via the ShotLink system used in pro events.  With the advent of consumer-level shot tracking systems, it is now possible to generated expected scores for virtually all levels of golfers, and thus any golfer can track strokes gained for their round, as compared to any level of golfer.\n\nStrokes gained is typically further broken down into 4 categories : Off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting.\n\nThe insights available once strokes gained was available has allowed insights into what really allows golfer to separate themselves from their competition.  Most notably, strokes gained was able to show that skill in driving is much more of a separator than is putting skill.

For example, a neural network may be more effective than a linear regression model for some types of data.[13]\n3) Increase the amount of training data: If the model is underfitting due to lack of data, increasing the amount of training data may help. This will allow the model to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.[13]\n4) Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large parameter values. It can also be used to prevent underfitting by controlling the complexity of the model.[14]\n5) Ensemble Methods: Ensemble methods combine multiple models to create a more accurate prediction. This can help to reduce underfitting by allowing multiple models to work together to capture the underlying patterns in the data.[15]\n6) Feature engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new model features from the existing ones that may be more relevant to the problem at hand.

{"instruction": "How does a push rod internal combustion engine work?", "context": "", "response": "The heart of a push rod internal combustion engine (ICE) is the crankshaft. Rods connect the engines pistons to the journals of the crankshaft. The crankshaft is evenly balanced by  weights on the opposite side of each journal to ensure that at high revolutions per minute (RPM) the motor is stable. As the crankshaft rotates it pushes the rods up and down that are connected to pistons. At the front of the crankshaft is a gear, the gear is typically connected via a chain to the camshaft. If the crankshaft is the heart of the engine, a camshaft is the brain of the engine. The camshaft determines when to open and close valves that let in air and fuel into each cylinder and let out exhaust from the internal combustion. The camshaft is a shaft that runs the length of the engine and has lobes on it, small metal cylinders called lifters ride on these lobes and are connected to push rods, the push rods are connected to rockers which rock back and forth opening and closing valves in the cylinder heads. The valves are located in the cylinder heads that sit on top of the cylinders that the pistons are in. As the pistons rotate up, a valve (being driven by the camshaft) opens to bring fuel into the cylinder, when the valve closes a spark from a spark plug, ignites the fuel causing a mini explosion pushing the cylinder down, a second valve opens letting the exhaust from the mini explosion exit the engine. This in turn rotates the crankshaft, pushing another piston up where the process continues. An intake manifold is like the lungs of a motor, it breaths in air from the atmosphere and mixes it with just the right amount of fuel to create that mini explosion in the cylinder.  The timing of the air, fuel, spark delivery is critical if it is off just the smallest of margins the engine will not run at all.", "category": "general_qa"}

But overtime, you start feeling the benefits. For some people it takes days, for some months. But just learn to sit in peace with yourself.\n2. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with: I went through 3-4 therapists and therapy styles till I found the right one. And I wouldn't want it any other way. I used to think therapy is useless, but now I swear by it.\n3. Set time aside in the day to stress: For example, I used to set aside 8 PM to stress. When I would feel anxious about something I could not control, I would just tell myself that I will think about it at 8 PM. It takes practice but it helps.\n4. Go outdoors or find a hobby group: As much as I love my bed and TV, just getting myself out there between people helped me so much. I would recommend it for everyone. Being in introvert, I used to hate being around new people. Now I just put myself out there and I know people almost everywhere I go for my hobbies.\n5. It's ok to take medication. If anxiety and depression are spoiling your quality of life, it's ok to speak to a psychiatrist and see if they can recommend any medication. It almost was taboo growing up for me, but now I see the benefits.\n6. Talk your partners / close friends and express your feelings. Take support from people around you. If they know you are struggling, they will be sensitive enough to help you out.\nHope this helps.", "category": "general_qa"}

Young white wines are clear and look like water, while older wines that have been aged in oak get a gold tint. Young red wines are vivid purplish red while older wines have brownish tones. \nSwirl the wine - Swirling the wine helps to expose the wine to more oxygen and release its aroma, this is called as aerating the wine. Watch how the wine runs down the glass. If the streaks of wine are thick and run relatively slow the wine has more sugar or alcohol. If the wine is thin and runs down the glass fast it has less alcohol. \nSmell the wine - After you swirl the wine take a sniff and it will smell much more vibrant. There are three types of aromas that wines have: primary are  fruity or floral, secondary ones come from aging in the barrels and tertiary are aging signs.\nSip the wine - Take a sip of the wine and spread it around your mouth to detect the different type of taste it provides. The tip of the tongue will give you the sweetness while the sides give you a good indication of sourness or acidity. \nSavor the wine- How does the wine feel after. Does it leave a bitterness or leathery feel on your tongue, it means the wine has more tannins.Does the wine feel light or dense , will give you a sense of whether it is light or medium bodied. \n\nAfter you have gone through the steps the most important thing is if you liked the wine.

{"instruction": "How can you take good star photos?", "context": "", "response": "Taking good star photos requires 3 critical elements: good observation conditions, good equipment and plenty of time. Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky, see what happens when you include the ground or not, and remember to let your eyes adjust to the dark and look around yourself, while you're taking the photos!", "category": "open_qa"}

The major advantage comes from using a high optical resolution mouse to control the player’s viewpoint.  In the FPS world, this translates to targeting an opponent.  The mouse allows for extremely fine grained movement of the viewing reticle to hone in on specific areas such as the target’s head.  Hitting the head often immediately results in death for the target or significant loss of health.  Additionally, the operator has access to other keys on the keyboard for quick access to a wider range of functions which differ based on the game.

On the other hand, minimally invasive options might not provide as much visibility into the surgical site as an open incision would, and depending on the procedure might not promote the type of fusion required. Of course, any surgical decision should be made by a trained and qualified physician and will depend entirely on the specific circumstances presented by the patient.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "What is the difference between a GPU and a CPU?", "context": "", "response": "Central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) have very different roles. The CPU can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores.\n\nWhile CPUs and GPUs have a lot in common - Both are critical computing engines. Both are silicon-based microprocessors. And both handle data - they do have different architectures and are built for different purposes.\n\nThe CPU is suited to a wide variety of workloads, especially those for which latency or per-core performance are important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its smaller number of cores on individual tasks and on getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing to running databases.\n\nGPUs began as specialized ASICs developed to accelerate specific 3D rendering tasks. Over time, these fixed-function engines became more programmable and more flexible. While graphics and the increasingly lifelike visuals of today’s top games remain their principal function, GPUs have evolved to become more general-purpose parallel processors as well, handling a growing range of applications.", "category": "general_qa"}

The species is frugivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests, including seasonally inundated swamp forests. Because of political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos, there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.\n\nAlong with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. As the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the Congo River 1.5–2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. Bonobos typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but it is almost certainly much shorter.", "response": "Wild bonobos inhabit forests and swamps within a 500,000 km2 region of the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of Congo.", "category": "information_extraction"}

{"instruction": "What kind of espresso machine is best for home use?", "context": "", "response": "Home espresso machines are a growing segment of the small kitchen appliance market. A good home espresso machine provides the ability to make high quality espresso in a machine that is typically smaller and less expensive than their commercial counterparts. \n\nThere are three common espresso machine designs for home use: manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. As the name implies -- manual machines require direct \"manual\" control by the user, who typically applies pressure through a lever to deliver the desired brew pressure. Semi-automatic machines require the user to prepare the coffee into the portafilter, but then rely on an automated pump and to deliver the desired brew pressure for espresso. Fully automatic machines automate the entire process end-to-end: grinding the beans, loading the ground beans into the portafilter, and then pumping water through the portafilter at predefined pressure levels to brew espresso. \n\nManual machines typically have a lower cost, smaller footprint, and provide the user with more direct control over the brewing process. This allows skilled users to make higher-quality espresso than they would with a more automated machine. In contrast, fully automatic machines are often the easiest to use, but are unable to make espresso as consistently great as a skilled barista could with a manual machines. Fully automatic machines are inherently more complex, more expensive to purchase, and more likely to have longer-term reliability issues. \n\nRegardless of the type of espresso machine, two factors influence how well they will perform: their ability to manage brew temperature and brew pressure. The best machines provide the ability to vary brew temperature and pressure in consistent, repeatable ways.The type of coffee bean and desired result will impact what temperature and pressure profile the user wants. The best machines offer flexibility along both dimensions in consistent, repeatable ways.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "What is a spatial network?", "context": "", "response": "A spatial network (sometimes also geometric graph) is a graph in which the vertices or edges are spatial elements associated with geometric objects, i.e., the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain metric. The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.", "category": "open_qa"}

Yet even as the Lighthouse stands constant night and day, season after season, it remains curiously unattainable.

James, finally reaching the Lighthouse in Chapter 3 a decade after he’d first wanted to go, sees that, up close, the Lighthouse looks nothing like it does from across the bay. That misty image he’d desired from a distance remains unattainable even when he can sail right up to the structure it’s supposedly attached to. The novel’s title can be understood as a description for experience itself: one moves through life propelled by desire towards the things one wants, and yet seems rarely to reach them. One’s life, then, is the process of moving towards, of reaching, of desiring. It is “to” the Lighthouse, not “at” it", "category": "creative_writing"}

But water, it turns out, is one of the least concerns. Semiconductor manufacturing needs a big ecosystem to get the best cost position. Semiconductor manufacturing need to have not just one company or one fab, but a big cluster of 10 to 15 of these things, to be able to get that world class performance and to be able to build a big enough ecosystem around you.This includes everything from equipment suppliers, which are needed to update and perform maintenance on chipmaking machines, to companies providing chemicals and other materials needed in making chips.Arizona has such a complete semiconductor supply chain already is thanks in no small part to Intel. Back in 1980, Intel started manufacturing microcontroller chips at its facility in Chandler, Arizona which is now Intel's largest manufacturing site in the world. In addition to Intel, leading semiconductor makers including NXP, ON Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Microchip, Broadcom and Benchmark Electronics have also built facilities in the state. Apart from its cluster of semiconductor companies, geopolitics have also worked in Arizona's favor. Arizona was also a more politically savvy state for fresh investment than strongly Democratic Washington. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, was a close ally of Trump throughout both of his presidential campaigns", "response": "TSMC chose Arizona for its chip making facility because Arizona already has an ecosystem of  equipment suppliers, fabrication units.

{"instruction": "From this text, find out the pros and cons of dredging", "context": "Dredging is the excavation of material from a water environment. Possible reasons for dredging include improving existing water features; reshaping land and water features to alter drainage, navigability, and commercial use; constructing dams, dikes, and other controls for streams and shorelines; and recovering valuable mineral deposits or marine life having commercial value. In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant, known as a dredger.\n\nDredging is carried out in many different locations and for many different purposes, but the main objectives are usually to recover material of value or use, or to create a greater depth of water. Dredges have been classified as suction or mechanical. Dredging systems can either be shore-based, brought to a location based on barges, or built into purpose built vessels.\n\nDredging has significant environmental impacts: it can disturb marine sediments, leading to both short- and long-term water pollution, destroy important seabed ecosystems, and can release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment. These environmental impacts can significantly hurt marine wildlife populations, contaminate sources of drinking water and interrupt economic activities such as fishing.", "response": "The benefits of dredging are:\n1. improves existing water features for better drainage, navigability, and commercial use\n2. important for constructing dams, dikes, and other controls for streams and shorelines\n3. helps in recovering valuable mineral deposits or marine life having commercial value\n\nThe demerits of dredging are related to its severe environmental impact, for example:\n1. it can disturb marine sediments, leading to both short- and long-term water pollution\n2. it can destroy important seabed ecosystems\n3. it can release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment\nAll the above impacts can significantly hurt marine wildlife populations, contaminate sources of drinking water and interrupt economic activities such as fishing.", "category": "information_extraction"}

Mbappe is thought to be the best young player in the game now, gracing the cover of the popular FIFA video game for the last two years.\n\nStill more could argue that the player with the most goals scored would be the best player.

She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper Bild. Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.[11]", "response": "The Barbie Doll was invented by Ruth Handler, who was inspired by a German Doll called Bild Lilli.

Meno begins the dialogue by asking Socrates whether virtue is taught, acquired by practice, or comes by nature.[1] In order to determine whether virtue is teachable or not, Socrates tells Meno that they first need to determine what virtue is. When the characters speak of virtue, or rather arete, they refer to virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work showcases Socratic dialectical style; Meno, unable to adequately define virtue, is reduced to confusion or aporia.[2] Socrates suggests that they seek an adequate definition for virtue together. In response, Meno suggests that it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it.[3]\n\nSocrates challenges Meno's argument, often called \"Meno's Paradox\" or the \"Learner's Paradox\", by introducing the theory of knowledge as recollection (anamnesis). As presented in the dialogue, the theory proposes that souls are immortal and know all things in a disembodied state; learning in the embodied is actually a process of recollecting that which the soul knew before it came into a body.[4] Socrates demonstrates recollection in action by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno's slaves.[5] Subsequently, Socrates and Meno return to the question of whether virtue is teachable, employing the method of hypothesis. Near the end of the dialogue, Meno poses another famous puzzle, called \"The Meno Problem\" or \"The Value Problem for Knowledge\", which questions why knowledge is valued more highly than true belief.[6] In response, Socrates provides a famous and somewhat enigmatic distinction between knowledge and true belief.", "response": "- arete: virtues in general, i.e. instead of a particular virtue\n- aporia: confusion\n- anamnesis: recollection of knowledge", "category": "information_extraction"}

Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.", "response": "More intense storms and droughts; Heat waves and wild fires are more common; Extinction of animal species; Increased food and water scarcity", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "What is GeneBass?", "context": "", "response": "GeneBass is a CRISPR-Cas9 screening platform for the high-throughput functional analysis of genes in mammalian cells. The GeneBass platform allows researchers to systematically activate or repress genes of interest and study their effects on cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The system uses a pooled lentiviral library of guide RNAs targeting every gene in the human or mouse genome, which can be introduced into cells using viral transduction. The guide RNAs are designed to target specific regions of the genome adjacent to the transcription start sites of each gene, allowing for specific and efficient gene activation or repression. GeneBass experiments typically involve the transduction of large numbers of cells, followed by selection or sorting of cells based on specific phenotypes of interest. High-throughput sequencing of the guide RNA library before and after selection can be used to identify genes that are essential for specific cellular processes or that are involved in disease pathways.", "category": "open_qa"}
