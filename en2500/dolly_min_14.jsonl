There are six different types of pieces in chess, including: Pawns, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, a Queen, and a King. Each of these pieces can move on the board in different ways. The goal of the game is to utilize your pieces to capture your opponent's king. In a game of chess, players alternate turns moving one piece at a time. When a player moves a piece, they are either positioning the piece on an open square where no other piece is currently on, or they are capturing an opponent's piece. To win a game of chess, players will balance strategically positioning their pieces and capturing their opponent's pieces. Doing so will allow a player to have the opportunity to put their opponent in a position called \"Checkmate\". When a player is checkmated, it means that their King is in an attacking line of one or more of their opponent's pieces and they have no legal moves to escape this attack. If a player is checkmated, they have lost the game.", "category": "general_qa"}

An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.\nAn electric field generally varies in space and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, so it follows that an electric field is a vector field.\nThe study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.", "response": "Gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.", "category": "information_extraction"}

{"instruction": "What creates moon phases and how is it different from an eclipse?", "context": "", "response": "The moonlight we see on Earth is sunlight reflecting off the Moon surface. How much of the Moon we see changes day-to-day and is called lunar phases. The Moon orbits Earth and Earth orbits the Sun. Everything is moving. The phases of the moon are actually just a result of our perception of the moon's half-illuminated surface. When the moon does pass through Earth's shadow the result is a lunar eclipse.\n\nThe phases of the moon are the changes in the amount of the surface of the moon that are illuminated by the Sun from the perspective of earth. When the surface of the side of the moon facing Earth is completely illuminated, we see a full moon. When none of the surface is illuminated and we can’t see the moon at all, the phase is a new moon. When half the side of the moon facing Earth is lit up, the phases are called the first and third quarters. When the visible moon appears to be getting bigger, we say it is waxing; when the visible lighted surface seems to be getting smaller, we say the moon is waning. When less than half of the visible moon is lit, it’s called a crescent, and when it’s more than half, it’s called a gibbous.\n\nDuring a lunar eclipse, Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the sunlight falling on the Moon. Earth's shadow covers all or part of the lunar surface.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "Where can set theory be applied?", "context": "Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.\n\nThe modern study of set theory was initiated by the German mathematicians Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor in the 1870s. In particular, Georg Cantor is commonly considered the founder of set theory. The non-formalized systems investigated during this early stage go under the name of naive set theory. After the discovery of paradoxes within naive set theory (such as Russell's paradox, Cantor's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox) various axiomatic systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice) is still the best-known and most studied.\n\nSet theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for the whole of mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.[1] Besides its foundational role, set theory also provides the framework to develop a mathematical theory of infinity, and has various applications in computer science (such as in the theory of relational algebra), philosophy and formal semantics. Its foundational appeal, together with its paradoxes, its implications for the concept of infinity and its multiple applications, have made set theory an area of major interest for logicians and philosophers of mathematics. Contemporary research into set theory covers a vast array of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.", "response": "Sets can be applied to virtually any application, given that the application can be represented via a logical set of mathematical objects.", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "How do formula one cars generate downforce?", "context": "Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by the cars following directly behind, making it hard to overtake. Major changes made to the cars for the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier.[3] The cars are dependent on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.[4]", "response": "Formula one cars generate downforce mainly using front and rear wings.", "category": "closed_qa"}

After the war, when mass market commercialism became available, baseball and its products were the primary sport marketed to people across the country. Many of the first American celebrities were in fact baseball players, their faces and names seen by millions of people through the rising circulation of newspapers and distribution of baseball cards.\n\nEven later, baseball was at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement. Jackie Robinson became the first Black player to play Major League Baseball in the modern era. The integration of baseball was an early and important step in the broader Civil Rights Movement. Since then, baseball has been one of the most diverse sports in the world, its demographics closely representing that of the whole country.\n\nIn many ways, baseball culture has become synonymous with American culture in general. The season takes place through summer. There are hot dogs, nachos, a lot of sitting around, fireworks, and games on 4th of July.\n\nSo even as more countries and cultures find a way to make baseball their own, the sport can always claim its place as America's Pastime.", "category": "general_qa"}

They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15 ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10–15 cm (4–6 in) long and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at the base to form interpetiolar stipules, characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of an inferior ovary, also characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5 cm (0.6 in).[43] When immature, they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries[44] have only one; these are called peaberries.[45] Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta takes nine to eleven months.[46]\n\nCoffea arabica is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result, the seedlings are generally uniform and vary little from their parents. In contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and require outcrossing.

Given that pB is usually 0, the equation becomes R=-C +D and in order for the R to be a positive value (which means a citizen will vote), we need civic duty to “outweigh” the cost of voting. \nThe Rational Choice model has two competing views on how voters choose to vote.  One is proximity voting.  In this case, the voter chooses the candidate that they are the closest to in terms of where that candidate sits on a liberal/conservative line.

Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur.[74] Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active.[74] In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation.[74] In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells.[74]", "response": "Operons are clusters of genes that share the same promoter.

It is heat that destroys vitamins, not cold. In fact, in an airtight container, most cooked food will last 2-3 days at the minimum and up to a week in many cases. In the freezer, food will last up to 6 months (assuming no power cuts). All biological activity slows down with temperature.\n\nThere are a few exceptions - plain cooked/steamed rice can sometimes be infected by a bacteria that doesn't mind low temperatures, so it's best to consume it within 1-2 days.\n\nBonus point: Indian food, is uniquely fridge friendly because it tends to be spicy, salty and sour - these are three conditions microbes absolutely hate.", "category": "open_qa"}

Despite the low speed of travel (≈10–40 km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed and often scored ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snowpacks that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93).[7] At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles at the end of the winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.", "response": "Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snowpacks that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water.", "category": "summarization"}

While many learn to ski when they're young, there are lots of people that only started to ski at an older age. With the right motivation and a willingness to put time and effort, almost anyone can learn to ski. Also, advances to ski equipment and slope grooming technology make skiing a lot safer than it used to be years ago.\n\nLearning to ski as an adult may take longer than learning as a child. It is recommended that you start with some lessons first to gain the right technique. This could be group lessons or private lessons. You could also learn from friends who know how to ski, or learn by watching online tutorials and applying them yourself on the mountain. Once you have the basic skills, you should be able to ski easy slopes and start enjoying skiing as a fun activity. \n\nIn addition to lessons, you will also need the right gear to ski. This includes appropriate clothing that can keep you warm on the mountain while you ski, as well as ski equipment that you will use. It is recommended that you get a pair of skis and poles, good fitting boots, a helmet for safety, and goggles to protect your eyes from the elements. Renting your equipment is a good option when you're starting. That way you are not making an expensive commitment upfront. You could also buy your equipment either new or from any of the second-hand ski shops and ski swaps.\n \nWith the right gear and knowledge of the basics, you can take your learning in any direction you want. Many people choose to stay at a beginner or intermediate level and just enjoy the occasional ski trip with friends. While others take their passion forward with more practice, hours on the mountain, and likely more lessons to get to advanced levels.\n\nWhichever path you pick, skiing can be a fun sport to learn and enjoy for the rest of your life.

In 1973 the official title of the British Team had been changed from \"Great Britain\" to \"Great Britain and Ireland\", but this was simply a change of name to reflect the fact that golfers from the Republic of Ireland had been playing in the Great Britain Ryder Cup team since 1953, while Northern Irish players had competed since 1947.

As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.
