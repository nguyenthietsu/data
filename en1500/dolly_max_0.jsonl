{"instruction": "Who was John Moses Browning?", "context": "John Moses Browning (January 23, 1855 – November 26, 1926) was an American firearm designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms – many of which are still in use around the world. He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.\n\nBrowning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt–Browning Model 1895 machine gun – a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.\n\nBrowning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 – the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. The Browning-designed M1911 and Hi-Power are some of the most copied firearms in the world.", "response": "John Moses Browning is one of the most well-known designer of modern firearms.

Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.\n\nAmong the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth.[14] His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries.[15] He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nJefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.\n\nJefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism,[4] and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800.[16] Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment.\n\nSince the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.[17][18][19]\n\nAfter retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery.

It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Siècle des Lumières, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]\n\nMembers of the movement saw themselves as a progressive élite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.[1]\n\nThis intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumières movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of \"enlightenment\" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.\n\nIn the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy.", "category": "open_qa"}

John Conyers Jr. (D-MI) reintroduced to the United States Congress every year from 1989 until his resignation in 2017.[51] As its name suggests, the bill recommended the creation of a commission to study the \"impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of our nation\".,[52] however there are cities and institutions which have initiated reparations in the US (see § Legislation and other actions for a list).\n\nIn 1999, African-American lawyer and activist Randall Robinson, founder of the TransAfrica advocacy organization, wrote that America's history of race riots, lynching, and institutional discrimination have \"resulted in $1.4 trillion in losses for African Americans\".[53] Economist Robert Browne stated the ultimate goal of reparations should be to \"restore the black community to the economic position it would have if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination\".[54] He estimates a fair reparation value anywhere between $1.4 to $4.7 trillion, or roughly $142,000 (equivalent to $162,000 in 2021) for every black American living today.[54] Other estimates range from $5.7 to $14.2[55] and $17.1 trillion.[56]\n\nIn 2014, American journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates published an article titled \"The Case for Reparations\", which discussed the continued effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws and made renewed demands for reparations. Coates refers to Rep. John Conyers Jr.'s H.R.40 Bill, pointing out that Congress's failure to pass this bill expresses a lack of willingness to right their past wrongs.[57]\n\nIn September 2016, the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent encouraged Congress to pass H.R.40 to study reparations proposals. Still, the Working Group did not directly endorse any specific reparations proposal. The report noted that there exists a legacy of racial inequality in the United States, explaining that \"Despite substantial changes since the end of the enforcement of Jim Crow and the fight for civil rights, ideology ensuring the domination of one group over another, continues to negatively impact the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today.\" The report notes that a \"dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion among the US population\".[58]\n\nThe topic of reparations gained renewed attention in 2020[59] as the Black Lives Matter movement named reparations as one of their policy goals in the United States.\n\nIn 2020, rapper T.I. supported reparations that would give every African American US$1 million and asserted that slavery caused mass incarcerations, poverty, and other ills.[60]", "response": "In spite of progressive changes since the end of enforcement of Jim Crow and the successes of the fight for civil rights there are still inherent racial inequalities in the USA which negatively affect the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today.

{"instruction": "Is beauty objective or subjective?", "context": "", "response": "The opinions on this question vary from person to person. \nStatistically, a pattern of preference is easily visible on what people would describe as beautiful. An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. \nA link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. \nHowever, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.\n\nFurthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing.

{"instruction": "Give me five ways in which I can make my homebrew beer more interesting", "context": "", "response": "There are infinite ways to create interesting flavours, that are either personal favourites or attempt to replicate classic beers and beer styles. There are a number of factors that make up a beers flavour profile and part of the enjoyment brewing your own beer at home, is that you can play around with each of these to change the flavour and character of your homebrew beer. Here are five ways in which you can change your own homebrew recipe to add interesting flavours or alternatively you can alter an existing homebrew recipe shared by somebody else or a brewery.\n\n1. Use different hops\nThere is a huge variety of hops available to homebrewers and each of these can introduce its own particular flavour and aroma to your beer, ranging from pineapple and apricots, to pine trees and woods, to grapefruit pith and lemon zest. By using a different hop in your recipe either from the same family or from an entirely different family of hops, you can easily add interesting and often radical changes to the flavour profile of your beer. However, depending on when the hops are added in the brewing process, you can also increase/decrease the levels of bitterness of your beer, due to different hop varieties having different levels of alpha acids.\n\n2. Use a different yeast\nBesides fermenting the beer, yeast leave behind lots of interesting flavours and can give your homebrew it's own subtle character. For example, English yeast strains can add malty and sweet flavours, California yeast tends to create a clean and crisp beer, whilst saison yeast adds bright and fruity flavours to your beer.\n\n3. Use different grains\nChanging the amount of base malts can increase or decrease the alcohol in your finished beer. Trying swapping one base malt for another, like American pale malts for a British variety, and look for the subtle differences between them. You can also play around with the specialty grains, like using a slightly darker roast.\n\n4. Add fruit, spices or herbs\nFruits, spices, herbs, and other ingredients are a great way to add an entirely personal character to your homebrew. Anything from fresh strawberries and basil to vanilla beans and cardamom can really complement the other malty, hoppy flavours in a beer. \n\n5. Alter your water profile\nDifferent beer styles will typically be best achieved with a suitable water profile, with different levels of minerals to achieve the desired flavour profile. By adjusting the amounts of specific minerals found in your brewing water, beer can be made to taste fuller bodied, sweeter, drier, more bitter, or even sour.", "category": "brainstorming"}
{"instruction": "What is HiFI?", "context": "High fidelity (often shortened to Hi-Fi or HiFi) is the high-quality reproduction of sound.[1] It is popular with audiophiles and home audio enthusiasts. Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the human hearing range.[2]\n\nHigh fidelity contrasts with the lower-quality “lo-fi” sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, AM radio, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.", "response": "Bell Laboratories began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s. Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra—that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound. After World War II, Harry F. Olson conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high-fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.[citation needed]\n\nBeginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made major improvements of home-audio quality possible:\n\nReel-to-reel audio tape recording, based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as Bing Crosby make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.\nThe advent of the 33⅓ rpm Long Play (LP) microgroove vinyl record, with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified equalization curves as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. Classical music fans, who were opinion leaders in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.\nHigher quality turntables, with more responsive needles\nFM radio, with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than AM radio.\nBetter amplifier designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible distortion.[3]\nNew loudspeaker designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by Edgar Villchur and Henry Kloss with improved bass frequency response.\nIn the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase high fidelity as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. Many consumers found the difference in quality compared to the then-standard AM radios and 78-rpm records readily apparent and bought high-fidelity phonographs and 33⅓ LPs such as RCA's New Orthophonics and London's FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK Decca system). Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, preamplifiers, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. With the advent of integrated multi-speaker console systems in the 1950s, hi-fi became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing phonograph and record player.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of stereophonic equipment and recordings led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the \"Golden Age of Hi-Fi\", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered superior by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (transistorized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.\n\nIn the 1960s, the FTC with the help of the audio manufacturers came up with a definition to identify high fidelity equipment so that the manufacturers could clearly state if they meet the requirements and reduce misleading advertisements.[4]\n\nThe metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974.[5] In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems.[5] Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available.[6] Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.[7]\n\nA popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated music centre—which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction.\n\nAudiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers, and other components.\n\nListening tests\nSee also: Codec listening test\nListening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines, and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid-state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which listeners cannot see the components being tested. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent,[8] a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.\n\nBlind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these blind tests is not accepted by some audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound in their evaluations of audio equipment. John Atkinson, current editor of Stereophile, stated that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that \"the magic was gone\" until he replaced it with a tube amp.[9] Robert Harley of The Absolute Sound wrote, in 2008, that: \"...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.\"[10]\n\nDoug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009.[11][12] He stated: \"Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so.\" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB, and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers.

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering[2] algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "response": "SVM stands for \"\"support vector machine\".

{"instruction": "Who coined the phrase \"Bike-shedding\" and when?", "context": "The law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that people within an organization commonly or typically give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.[1] Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.\n\nThe law has been applied to software development and other activities.[2] The terms bicycle-shed effect, bike-shed effect, and bike-shedding were coined based on Parkinson's example; it was popularised in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by the Danish software developer Poul-Henning Kamp in 1999[3] and, due to that, has since become popular within the field of software development generally.\n\nArgument\n\nA bicycle shed\nThe concept was first presented as a corollary of his broader \"Parkinson's law\" spoof of management. He dramatizes this \"law of triviality\" with the example of a committee's deliberations on an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on a bicycle shed. As he put it: \"The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved.\" A reactor is so vastly expensive and complicated that an average person cannot understand it (see ambiguity aversion), so one assumes that those who work on it understand it. However, everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle shed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone involved wants to implement their own proposal and demonstrate personal contribution.[4]\n\nAfter a suggestion of building something new for the community, like a bike shed, problems arise when everyone involved argues about the details. This is a metaphor indicating that it is not necessary to argue about every little feature based simply on having the knowledge to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.[3]\n\nThe law of triviality is supported by behavioural research. People tend to spend more time on small decisions than they should, and less time on big decisions than they should. A simple explanation is that during the process of making a decision, one has to assess whether enough information has been collected to make the decision. If people make mistakes about whether they have enough information, they will tend to stop too early for big decisions. The reason is that big decisions require collecting information for a long time. It leaves more time to make a mistake (and stop) before getting enough information. Conversely, for small decisions, where people should stop early, they may continue to ponder for too long by mistake.[5]\n\nRelated principles and formulations \nThere are several other principles, well-known in specific problem domains, which express a similar sentiment.\n\nWadler's law, named for computer scientist Philip Wadler,[6] is a principle which asserts that the bulk of discussion on programming-language design centers on syntax (which, for purposes of the argument, is considered a solved problem), as opposed to semantics.\n\nSayre's law is a more general principle, which holds (among other formulations) that \"In any dispute, the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake\"; many formulations of the principle focus on academia.", "response": "The phrase \"bike-shedding\" was introduced in 1957 by C.

{"instruction": "As a golfer, how can I fix my slice?", "context": "", "response": "A common swing fault in golfers is a slice which is caused when the face of the club isn't aligned properly to the swing path of the club.  What will typically happen is at the time of impact, the face is open in relation to the target (ie aimed to the right if you are a right handed golfer) and the swing path is closed in relation to the target (ie aimed to the left if you are a left handed golfer).  When there is a large difference between the path of the swing and the face of the club, the impact will generate a high degree of lateral spin on the ball causing the flight of the ball to curve away from the target.  Here are some ways to fix this swing fault:\n\n1. Grip the club with a stronger grip.  This means the v formed between your thumb and pointer finger on back hand is pointed to your rear shoulder and your opposite hand it also gripping the club more from the back.  This will help you close the face of the club at impact.\n2. Focus on keeping the face closed in the backswing.  One fault many amateurs have is the club face opens toward the sky on the backswing too far meaning that the face will need to turn more on the downswing to get to square at impact.  Creating less rotation on the backswing can help with this.  \n3. Keeping hips down and back in the downswing.  One fault that can cause inconsistent contact as well as a slice is when the hips thrust forward during the downswing causing the golfer to lift up to counter being too close to the ball which can often cause an over the top, out-to-in swing path.  Try to keep the hips back through the swing and focus on rotating the body to keep forward or lateral movement to a minimum.  \n\nA slice is a very common issue among golfers but knowing the causes and swing faults that lead to a slice can help you think about how you can improve your swing to fix it.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "What is more important in society, freedom or safety?", "context": "", "response": "In our society, freedom and safety are both valued. While many other countries may put safety first, the harsh reality for Americans is that freedom always comes before safety. Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.\nThe 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.\nOften a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?\nOn the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.\nTo be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait.", "category": "creative_writing"}

Provide an example of how these APIs might work.", "context": "", "response": "As a kid, I loved watching the Jetsons. As I grew older and ended up writing software and creating & implementing architectures for systems, I thought I would never see the day when a Jetsons-like kitchen would be feasible.\nGPT (ChatGPT, etc.) has changed my mind.\n\nContractual Obligations\nAs an architect, you kind of need to think like a lawyer. You define contracts (APIs) between systems or components. You monitor those APIs for abuse or misuse.\n\nI would use Swagger editor to define those contracts, and I would write the APIs to match interactions implied in mock-ups. I would vet the design with the team, I would walk through scenarios to see if the API would fit the use case and would not introduce performance bottlenecks, and I would simulate and automate as much as I could along the journey.\n\nI was very careful to get it right the first time. It was never perfect the first time, of course. So, I also had to consider how the API could evolve while minimizing costs/impact to the rest of the system. The API, once deployed, would become something I would guard, like an honest politician guards the #usconstitution. The team had to be careful with any change that impacted the API.\n\nAPI Mesh... More like API mess!\nAPIs rely on APIs which rely on more APIs and libraries. Once a system gets large enough, that complexity becomes a bottleneck. Small changes can have a huge ripple effect. Some approaches (like federated #GraphQL) help manage this complexity nicely. But it still involves an API under which there can exist a lot of fragility. #Agile or not, developing a complicated web of APIs is complex, requires specialized skills, and is full of unforeseen challenges.\n\nThe Kitchen Conversation, ChatGPT-style\nThe Jetsons' kitchen involves a number of systems, each composed of various parts, sensors, hardware, inputs and outputs. Considering the complexity of interactions between independent systems in a kitchen, the fact that the Jetsons' kitchen components would come from various vendors or manufacturers, traditional API design would not be able to fulfill the vision. Not practical, at all.\n\nNow, let's think about APIs and the Jetsons' kitchen, #chatgpt -style.\n\nLet's keep it simple: pizza. You (or your robot) make a pizza from scratch.\n\nThe oven asks the refrigerator: \"I see we have a pizza. Can you tell me if this is low-moisture mozzarella?\"\n\nRefrigerator: \"That's not even mozzarella. This pizza must have Muenster cheese as that is all I had in me. And the human removed some of the contents 30 minutes ago, so the probability of Muenster cheese on that pizza is quite high.\"\n\nA sensor from the kitchen who has eyes across the room chimes in at this point. Sensor: \"Beware that the crust of this pizza is made of cauliflower. I agree with the video sensor's assessment regarding the type of cheese. No new cheese entered the kitchen recently.\"\n\nOven: \"Anything else I should know?\"\n\nSensor: \"The temperature of the dough is 47F. This is cooler than the expert chef consensus of using room-temperature dough.\"\n\nOven: \"Great. I know what to do. Since the dough is cool, I will start cooking with a temperature a little lower than the recipe specifies. Then I will increase the temp of bottom element so as to provide a nice crisp crust. I will keep a close eye on moisture and may use convection to mitigate any undesirable levels of moisture.\"\n\nWhere is the API that contractually binds the independent systems? APIs are not gone. For instance, the brain of the Oven will have myriad APIs (e.g. for interacting with temperature controllers and sensors, etc.). The key here is that the interface between systems is no longer a fixed, rigid API. No method signatures, no paths, no payload specifications. Instead, a conversation relating to senses and capabilities.\n\nWhat \"brain\"?\nKence Anderson's book Designing Autonomous AI describes nicely how a complex system can be decomposed into a number of independent \"brains.\" Each brain, in his book, can be independently developed and refined, with human guidance married with #datascience, #machinelearning and #dataengineering.\n\nWhat's Cookin'?\nI am excited for what the future holds. How architects rethink complex system design with regards to APIs is, in my opinion, something that is inevitable. And, as an amateur pizza maker, my taste buds are watering for the day I get some GPT help to make an even better #detroitpizza.", "category": "creative_writing"}

Australia, the nearest test playing country to New Zealand, refused to grant Test status to any games played between the two nations until well after World War 2. This lack of test opportunities led to a now common path of talented New Zealanders moving off shore for the chance to play test cricket- most notably in the pre WWII period of Clarrie Grimmet, who took over 200 test wickets playing for Australia. Since then, Andrew Caddick (234 test wickets at an average of 29.91) and Ben Stokes (5000+ test runs and 196 test wickets) have played leading roles for England in tests.\n\nIf however we define the question as \"the best test cricket player to have played for New Zealand\", then there are perhaps only 3 or 4 candidates that feature. Of the current generation, there is no doubt that Kane Williamson will one day be regarded as the greatest player to have come from New Zealand- with over 8000 test runs at an average north of 50. With many years in front of him, Williamson will no doubt hold the crown of best test cricketer in years to come. \n\nMartin Crowe must likewise be regarded in the pantheon of test greats to have played for New Zealand- despite a slow start to his career, and injuries curtailing his time in the team, he amassed over 5000 runs at an average of over 45.\n\nHowever, most will agree that the most influential cricketer ever to play test cricket for New Zealand was Sir Richard Hadlee- the first cricketer to be knighted whilst still playing cricket for his country. Hadlee's bowling average of 22.29 is one of best in test cricket history, and at the time of his retirement he held the record for test wickets, at 431. Gaining 5 wickets in an innings 36 times was also a record, and led New Zealand to some of it's most famous test victories, notably victory in a series in Australia for the first time in 1985/86, with his best test figures of 15 for 123 coming in the first test at the Gabba.

Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.\nSunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages. The first one is civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon. The second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon. The third phase is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night.

As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces.

Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.[16][17]", "response": "After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970.

The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.\n\nIn 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.[5][6]\n\nOnyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.[7][8]\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[9] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.[10]\n\nIn 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System.[11] This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.\n\nIn 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.[12]\n\nThese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project.

Lincoln led the Union through the American Civil War to defend the nation as a constitutional union and succeeded in abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.\n\nLincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in central Illinois. In 1854, he was angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, and he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the nation. During this time, the newly formed Confederate States of America began seizing federal military bases in the south. Just over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina.

{"instruction": "Can I make chocolate at home?", "context": "", "response": "Making chocolate at home can be rewarding, but be prepared to spend a little money and a lot of time. The money goes to equipment and cocoa beans. For equipment, you will need a melanger (about $600)  to grind the beans and a tempering machine (about $400) to make the finished product. You will also need a silicone mat (about $20) and a hair dryer (about $30). But let's start at the beginning.\n\nBuy between two and six pounds of fermented raw cocoa beans. There are a variety of retail importers you can find on the web. Choose a single variety or a blend that appeals to your taste in chocolate.\n\nSort the beans, removing broken beans, badly misshapen beans, and whatever foreign bodies may be present.\n\nRoast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!\n\nLet the beans cool.\n\nPeel the beans. You can do this by hand - which I find produces a superior product - but be warned that this can take up to 6 hours per pound. Alternatively, you can purchase a winnower and use the hair dryer to blow out the skins. This approach is much faster, but leaves more skin and loses more bean fragments. Either way, weigh your final bean yield.\n\nGet you melanger going. Use the hair dryer to get the grinding surfaces up to at least 120F. Add the beans a handful at a time. Help the melanger along if it gets stuck. Make sure the melanger is going steadily before leaving it unattended. When it gets going, it will flow well.\n\nRun the melanger for 24 to 72 hours, again depending on your experience with the beans and your tastes. If trying a mix of beans, add the more robustly flavored beans early in the process and the more delicately flavored beans later. Give even the most delicate beans at least 8 hours. Add sugar to taste. The percentage of sugar by weight can vary from a few percent up to 30 percent. You may also add dried whole fat milk at this point, and other flavorings, like an inch or so of vanilla bean. Melange the sugar and other additives at least 8 more hours. The goal is to decrease the particle size below what can be detected by the  tongue. When done, decant into a silicone mat line baking pan. This is your untempered chocolate. it melts easily and tends to get crumbly as it ages. Which is why you will want to temper it.\n\nFinally, follow the directions on your tempering machine, adding chunks of untempered chocolate as indicated. The liquid tempered chocolate can be used for fruit dipping or can be poured into molds for bars or shaped candies. Other additives can be included at this stage - nuts, nougat etc. Cool the results at room temperature for several hours before serving.

The second, third and fourth season followed in April 2018, March 2020, and June 2022, respectively. Nolan and Joy planned a fifth and final season, and were in negotiations with HBO to produce it.[7] However, in November 2022, it was announced that HBO had canceled the series.[8] The series was removed from HBO Max on December 18, 2022.\n\nWestworld's debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective, in 2014. Westworld's first season is the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. The first season also received critical acclaim and was highly praised for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes and soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi. Reception of the series declined from the second season onwards, with the scripts, characterization and narrative opacity being targeted for criticism; viewership ratings also diminished throughout its run. It has received numerous accolades, winning nine Primetime Emmy Awards out of 54 nominations.

It caused US$550 million damage in Chile, while the tsunami that it spawned caused deaths and damage as far away as Hawaii, Japan and the Philippines. The 'rupture zone' of the quake was more than 1000 km long. Two days after the initial quake, the nearby volcano Puyehue erupted, sending ash and steam up to 6 km into the atmosphere over a period of several weeks.\n\n2. Prince William Sound, Alaska 28 March 1964 (magnitude 9.2)\nCompared to the Chilean earthquake, this earthquake was less damaging: the resulting tsunami took 128 lives and caused overall US$311 million in damage. The earthquake was felt mainly over Alaska, as well as some places in Canada, while the tsunami created by it caused damage as far away as Hawaii. The most damage was sustained by the city of Anchorage, 120 km north-west of the epicentre. Shaking from the quake itself is reported to have lasted for three minutes.\n\n3. Sumatra, Indonesia 26 December 2004 (magnitude 9.1)\nIn terms of damage and loss of life, the scale of the disaster caused by the resulting Boxing Day Tsunami was enormous. In total, 227,900 people were killed or presumed dead, with around 1.7 million displaced over 14 countries in South Asia and East Africa. The epicentre was 250 km south-east of Band Aceh, Indonesia, at a depth of 30 km. Several days later on 28 December, a mud volcano began erupting near Baratang, Andamar Islands, which is thought to have been associated with the earthquake.\n\n4. Sendai, Japan 11 March 2011 (magnitude 9.0)\nSo far the official death toll stands at several thousand from the combined effect of the powerful earthquake, aftershocks and the tsunami. However, the total is expected to rise, with some estimates of a final toll of over 10,000. Economic impacts are expected to be huge, with the shutting down of nuclear reactors which many industries rely on for power.\n\n5. Kamchatka, Russia 4 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0)\nThis earthquake generated a tsunami that caused widespread damage in the Hawaiian Islands. Property damage was estimated at around US$1,000,000. Some reports describe waves of over 9 m high at Kaena Point, Oahu. A farmer on Oahu reported the loss of six cows to the tsunami, but no people were reported killed.\n\n6. Bio-bio, Chile 27 February 2010 (magnitude 8.8)\nThis earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed at least 521 people, with 56 missing and 12,000 injured. More than 800,000 people were displaced with a total of 1.8m people affected across Chile, where damage was estimated at US$30 billion. The epicentre was 335 km south-west of Santiago, at a depth of 35 km. A minor tsunami travelled across the Pacific causing damage to boats as far away as San Diego, California.\n\n7. Off the coast of Ecuador 31 January 1906 (magnitude 8.8)\nThis earthquake caused a tsunami that is reported to have killed between 500 and 1,500 in Ecuador and Colombia. The tsunami travelled as far north as San Francisco, on the west coast of the US, and west to Hawaii and Japan. The tsunami took roughly 12 hours to cross the Pacific to Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n8. Rat Islands, Alaska 2 April 1965 (magnitude 8.7)\nThe worst of the damage attributed to this earthquake was caused by a tsunami, reported to be about 10 m high on Shemya Island. The wave caused flooding on Amchitka Island, causing US$10,000 in property damage. No deaths or injuries were reported.\n\n9.

{"instruction": "What are the benefits of division of labour?", "context": "The division of labour is the separation of the tasks in any economic system or organization so that participants may specialize (specialization). Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities, and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or natural resources as well as skills. Training and combinations of equipment and other assets acting together are often important. For example, an individual may specialize by acquiring tools and the skills to use them effectively just as an organization may specialize by acquiring specialized equipment and hiring or training skilled operators. The division of labour is the motive for trade and the source of economic interdependence.\n\nHistorically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total output and trade, the rise of capitalism, and the increasing complexity of industrialized processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient Sumerian (Mesopotamian) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.\n\nAfter the Neolithic Revolution, pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labour, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites. This specialization was furthered by the process of industrialization, and Industrial Revolution-era factories. Accordingly, many classical economists as well as some mechanical engineers, such as Charles Babbage, were proponents of division of labour. Also, having workers perform single or limited tasks eliminated the long training period required to train craftsmen, who were replaced with less-paid but more productive unskilled workers.", "response": "In general the following benefits are associated with increasing division of labour:\n- increase in total trade \n- increase in total output\n- an increase in market activity\n- increased specialization\n- increasing complexity of industrialized processes", "category": "summarization"}

NPCI set out with a mandate to change the face of India’s payment systems. It developed the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as an architecture framework with a set of standard Application Programming Interface (API) specifications to facilitate online payments. The aim was to simplify and provide a single interface across all NPCI systems, thereby creating interoperability and a superior customer experience.\n\nUPI is now one of the most preferred payment solutions in India, with over a billion transactions every month. FY22, the total transaction value processed by the United Payments Interface (UPI) platform accounted for 86% of India’s GDP. UPI’s core function is to support easy and secure money transfers between bank accounts. It does this by adding multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, allowing for seamless fund transfers and merchant payments from one place. It also enables ‘peer to peer’ and ‘peer to merchant’ collection requests, which can be scheduled and paid as requested.\n\nPayments can be made using a UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and an Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). Payment security is as per applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines using a 1-click 2-factor authentication where the second factor of authentication is the UPI PIN. \n\nUPI can be accessed on all major platforms such as Android and iOS with apps developed by members for versions of Android 4.2.2 and iOS 8.1 and above.\n\nThe primary business uses of UPI are to allow a personal mobile as the primary device for all payments, including person to person, person to entity, and entity to person. Using a personal mobile an individual can ‘Pay’ someone (push) as well as ‘Collect’ from\nsomeone (pull). In addition, the ability to pay and collect using ‘UPI IDs’ that are ‘aliases’ to the VPA. The goal is to make  payments by providing an address without having to ever provide account details or credentials on third party applications or websites.\nAlso, sending ‘collect’ requests to others (person to person or entity to person) with a‘pay by’ date, which allows customers to pay at a later date without blocking the money in the account. UPI also allows for pre-authorizing multiple recurring payments (utilities, school fees, subscriptions, etc.) with a one-time secure authentication and rule-based access, similar to ECS. UPI autopay allows customers to set recurring payments for their UPI transactions. Recurring payments up to Indian Rupees 2000 can be set at the frequency desired.\n\nThis makes payments using UPI a fully interoperable system across all PSPs without having silos and closed systems with one-click two-factor authentication, using a personal\nphone, and without any acquiring devices or physical tokens.\n\nIn March 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the linkage of UPI and Singapore’s PayNow. Remittances from Singapore to India were on track to breach the $100 billion mark in 2023, making it the fourth highest remitting nation to India, accounting for 5.7% of all inbound remittances.

It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest. African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008–2009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7, although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation.

There is some variety in their shapes depending on their masses, and curiously looking worlds might even exist, unlike anything we know from our system.\n\nEverything within a planet or a moon is under the influence of gravity in such a way that bits of it would move to the center if they could. Under ideal conditions, it would acquire a spherical shape. For objects made of something other than liquids, it varies at what point they become round. It is generally assumed that they mostly become spheres around 400 kilometers/248 miles in diameter when made from icy material commonly found in our Solar System. Still, if something is made from something more rigid, it needs to be larger in diameter than that - around 750 km/466 miles. At a sufficient mass, even rock becomes fluid-like. The moon of Mars Deimos is only 12.6 km/7.8 miles across and is not spherical, and there are many other small moons of other planets that don’t have a round shape.\n\nThis, however, is not all. Astronomical objects spin, giving them the flattened shape of a sphere the faster their rotation if they are massive enough. On top of it, they can have moons. This causes a bulge to form at the position of their orbiting body around them. In the case of Earth, our Moon causes tides via this process. Also, our Sun gives our planet tides. Elsewhere in the Universe, there could be planets with massive moons or two similarly massive planets, called double planets, orbiting their common center of mass, the barycenter, at a close distance, which can cause even stronger bulging. Their shape would be affected this way more visibly.\n\nFinally, a bizarre, toroidal planet, shown above, can be stable from what we know from physics, at least for a while. As I mentioned earlier, even rigid rock behaves like a fluid at large masses. An adequate rotation speed can counterbalance the strength of gravity with centrifugal acceleration, and a torus-shaped planet could exist. A possible scenario for such a world to come to be would be if two sufficiently fast rotating planets collided and formed a doughnut of vaporized rock, a so-called synestia.\n\nWe currently think that the events that would lead to the formation of a world of this shape are so unlikely that there might not be a single toroidal planet in the Visible Universe, but we were quite a few times surprised by what we discovered during our exploration of Cosmos.

If you want year around produce of fresh vegetables you can even plan to have a green house with heating to keep your plants alive in all seasons. Making the soil ready and adding some plant food at regular intervals is required to keep the produce at good numbers. The owner will have health benefits of stress free time during the time they work on the garden and when they see the produce on the dinner table in the form of a delicious dish. Owners have a great time posting their produce pictures and dishes to social media to share with friends. Each year they plan 3 to 4 months in advance on the kind of plants that they would like to plant in the garden. They work with friends to find the seeds for various plants that they like to plant as well as share tips to keep the garden healthy. The key benefit is the owner will be able to get fresh produce that does not use any harsh chemicals or pesticides.", "category": "general_qa"}

Less cylinders are usually cheaper, make the motorcycle more lightweight and thus easier to maneuver. More cylinders make the engine feel smoother, also have more power, but are heavier and more expensive.\n- Usage: What do you use it for? Just for fun, commuting to work, general transportation? Travel? Offroad? Racing?\n- Assistance systems: Modern motorcycles have a range of assistance systems like ABS, Cruise Control, Distance sensors, electronic driving modes for different weather conditions etc. They can make driving safer , but also add weight and make the bike more expensive. Which ones do you need?  \n- Style: There are different styles like naked bike, cruiser, chopper, dual sport, race bike , scrambler etc. Different styles can be more or less adequate depending on your usage, or you can simply pick the one that appeals to you.\n- Size: The two most important aspects in terms of size are seat height and weight. Both have a huge impact on how well you are in control when not driving, for example when you need to stop at a traffic light or going slowly in stop & go traffic.\nSeat height is important , so your feet can reach the ground when stopping.

Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland.

He tells the story of Julia Angwin, a journalist whose ProPublica investigation of the COMPAS algorithm, a tool for predicting recidivism among criminal defendants, led to widespread criticism of its accuracy and bias towards certain demographics. One of AI's main alignment challenges is its black box nature (inputs and outputs are identifiable but the transformation process in between is undetermined). The lack of transparency makes it difficult to know where the system is going right and where it is going wrong.\n\nAgency\nIn the second section, Christian similarly interweaves the history of the psychological study of reward, such as behaviorism and dopamine, with the computer science of reinforcement learning, in which AI systems need to develop policy (\"what to do\") in the face of a value function (\"what rewards or punishment to expect\"). He calls the DeepMind AlphaGo and AlphaZero systems \"perhaps the single most impressive achievement in automated curriculum design.\" He also highlights the importance of curiosity, in which reinforcement learners are intrinsically motivated to explore their environment, rather than exclusively seeking the external reward.\n\nNormativity\nThe third section covers training AI through the imitation of human or machine behavior, as well as philosophical debates such as between possibilism and actualism that imply different ideal behavior for AI systems. Of particular importance is inverse reinforcement learning, a broad approach for machines to learn the objective function of a human or another agent. Christian discusses the normative challenges associated with effective altruism and existential risk, including the work of philosophers Toby Ord and William MacAskill who are trying to devise human and machine strategies for navigating the alignment problem as effectively as possible.", "response": "In the first section, Prophecy, the author talks about predictive models making decisions that are difficult to examine and may become discriminative or unfair.\n\nIn the second section, Agency, about reinforcement learning systems, despite some remarkable achievements, are guided nearly exclusively by their objective function, not so much by curiosity to discover the world.\n\nIn the third section, Normativity, inverse reinforcement learning techniques face the challenge of figuring out the objective function of humans.", "category": "summarization"}

The debate as to whether the nature (the intrinsic nature, the attitude, or the predisposition), or the nurture (the care, the teachings, or the conditioning) of a child is more responsible for who or what they become in adult life. \n\nLargely it is considered that humans are a product of context (Nurture). The situations in which we are raised have a considerable bearing on who we become in later life. But, it's not necessarily so black and white. There are countless examples of children having been born into extremely difficult circumstances, who have grown to be well rounded, high contributing members of society. \n\nAs a result, It would be reasonable to assume that Nature is a strong factor, regardless of the Nurture (the environment) in which a person is raised. After all, there's no guarantee that someone growing up in an abusive household will then abuse others themselves. So then is Nature more important? \n\nThe difficulty with the debate is that no one individual is the same as another. Experiments to establish the efficacy of Nature vs Nurture are difficult to perform. Not only from a human rights perspective, but additionally from a variable standpoint as well. Really there are far too many variables to control with regards to human nature, that any imposition of control on the Nurture element would be imbalanced. \n\nWhen considering this question, it's important to recognise that developmental psychology is still in its early stages, and to understand that both Nature AND Nurture are necessary factors in human development.", "category": "creative_writing"}

Some would even use them to guard their smaller cousins, the alpaca.[37][38] They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.\n\nResearch suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.\n\nUsing llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.[39]", "response": "TLDR: LLamas can be used as livestock guards.

Also, the human brain tends to think linearly, causing us to underestimate the exponential progress of technology.

The letter — with notable signatories including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Andrew Yang — caused a stir, calling for a 6 month pause on advanced AI development:\n\n“Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.

AI systems can behave in ways that are unforeseen and difficult to control. The AI alignment problem is a societal challenge that requires collaboration between researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public.

{"instruction": "Which is the best work from Goethe?", "context": "The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were Götz von Berlichingen (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (German: Die Leiden des jungen Werthers) (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the Sturm und Drang period which marked the early phase of Romanticism. Indeed, Werther is often considered to be the \"spark\" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first \"best-seller\". During the years at Weimar before he met Schiller in 1794, he began Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship[42] and wrote the dramas Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris),[43] Egmont,[44] and Torquato Tasso[45] and the fable Reineke Fuchs.[46]To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (the continuation of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), the idyll of Hermann and Dorothea, the Roman Elegies and the verse drama The Natural Daughter.[47] In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared Faust Part One (1808), Elective Affinities (1809), the West-Eastern Diwan (an 1819 collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (From My Life: Poetry and Truth, published between 1811 and 1833) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his Italian Journey (1816–17), and a series of treatises on art. Faust, Part Two was completed before his 1832 death and published posthumously later that year.

A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.\n\nMalcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison he joined the Nation of Islam (adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding \"the White slavemaster name of 'Little'\"), and after his parole in 1952 quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration.[2][3] Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca, and became known as \"el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz,\"[4] which roughly translates to \"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\".[5][6][7] After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences; in 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.\n\nA controversial figure accused of preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his pursuit of racial justice. He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination, was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center.", "category": "information_extraction"}

By 1910, photographs had become the magazine's trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for \"dynamical pictures\" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom.The magazine began to feature some pages of color photography in the early 1930s, when this technology was still in its early development. During the mid-1930s, Luis Marden (1913–2003), a writer and photographer for National Geographic, convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called \"miniature\" 35 mm Leica cameras loaded with Kodachrome film over bulkier cameras with heavy glass plates that required the use of tripods.In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs. National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of National Geographic are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles.

{"instruction": "Given these paragraphs about Large language models, when was the first model in OpenAI's GPT series trained?", "context": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice.

The Warriors have the same starting lineup as last year with 4 All-Stars and when playing at Home their record is among the best in the league.  However, when playing on the road the Warriors have one of the worst records at 9-30.  A big factor in their road losses is lack of good defense, as opposing teams score considerably more points against the Warriors than when the Warriors play at home.

{"instruction": "According to the given paragraph, how do convolutional neural networks avoid overfitting in machine learning?", "context": "In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain–computer interfaces, and financial time series.\n\nCNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input.\n\nCNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons are usually fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"full connectivity\" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) Developing robust datasets also increases the probability that CNNs will learn the generalized principles that characterize a given dataset rather than the biases of a poorly-populated set.", "response": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has a fully connected layer in which each neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer, this structure helps to avoid overfitting", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "What is a bond in finance?", "context": "", "response": "In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.\n\nBonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nThe most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation.", "category": "open_qa"}

Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist, his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.\n\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in Shaoshan, Hunan. He supported Chinese nationalism and had an anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. He later adopted Marxism–Leninism while working at Peking University as a librarian and became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land reform policies, and ultimately became head of the CCP during the Long March. Although the CCP temporarily allied with the KMT under the Second United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), China's civil war resumed after Japan's surrender, and Mao's forces defeated the Nationalist government, which withdrew to Taiwan in 1949.\n\nOn 1 October 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the PRC, a Marxist–Leninist single-party state controlled by the CCP. In the following years he solidified his control through the Chinese Land Reform against landlords, the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, the \"Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns\", and through a truce in the Korean War, which altogether resulted in the deaths of several million Chinese. From 1953 to 1958, Mao played an important role in enforcing command economy in China, constructing the first Constitution of the PRC, launching the industrialisation program, and initiating military projects such as the \"Two Bombs, One Satellite\" project and Project 523. His foreign policies during this time were dominated by the Sino-Soviet split which drove a wedge between China and the Soviet Union. In 1955, Mao launched the Sufan movement, and in 1957 he launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in which at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals and dissidents, were persecuted.[2] In 1958, he launched the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from agrarian to industrial, which led to the deadliest famine in history and the deaths of 15–55 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement, and in 1966 he initiated the Cultural Revolution, a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of Mao's cult of personality. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During the Mao era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its family planning policy.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, Mao remains a controversial figure within and outside China. Beyond politics, Mao is also known as a theorist, military strategist, and poet. Mao has been credited with transforming China from a semi-colony to a leading world power, with greatly advanced literacy, women's rights, basic healthcare, primary education and life expectancy.[3][4][5][6] However, Mao's government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths, with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions.[7][8][9][10] During his leadership tenure, China was heavily involved with other Asian communist conflicts such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cambodian Civil War.", "response": "Mao's government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths, with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions.", "category": "closed_qa"}

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson.

It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815.[11][12]\n\nTensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Native American tribes who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates.[13] Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against.[d][14] News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.\nAt sea, the far larger Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 to 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada.[15] This was balanced by the US winning control of the Northwest Territory with victories at Lake Erie and the Thames in 1813. The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy.[16] In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war.\n\nIn August 1814, British troops burned Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. Fighting continued in the Southeastern United States, where in late 1813 a civil war had broken out between a Creek faction supported by Spanish and British traders and those backed by the U.S. Supported by U.S. militia under General Andrew Jackson, the U.S.-backed Creeks won a series of victories, culminating in the capture of Pensacola in November 1814.[17] In early 1815, Jackson defeated a British attack on New Orleans, catapulting him to national celebrity and later victory in the 1828 United States presidential election.[18] News of this success arrived in Washington at the same time as that of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which essentially restored the position to that prevailing before the war. While Britain insisted this included lands belonging to their Native American allies prior to 1811, as Congress did not recognize them as independent nations, the Americans did not comply with these provisions and the British made no effort to compel them to do so.

She looked around and spotted another shiny scale, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading her to the forest behind her house. She knew that her parents would want her to go to school but her curiosity got the better of her and she started to follow the trail of shiny scales to the forest. She fought her way through the forest until she came upon what looked like a cave that she was sure was not there before. She cautiously entered the cave and and instead of the cave getting darker, it was getting brighter, like a brilliant light was inside the cave. When she turned the corner in the cave, she saw the most beautiful sparkling dragon and could not believe her eyes! She slowly crept toward the dragon, who was watching her closely as she approached. She held out her hand as if to pet the dragon and the dragon sniffed her hand, then rubbed it's head on the bottom of her hand to signal that it wanted to befriend her. She giggled as the dragon purred and rubbed it's shiny body circling around her. The dragon then spoke and asked her if she had ever been to the beyond worlds. The girl shook her head, the dragon blinked her eyes and projected an image onto the cave wall to show one of the beautiful beyond worlds that was filled with dragons.

Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society's developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era's youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music's evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.\n\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to national prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired many young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the group had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks, and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were \"more popular than Jesus now\".\n\nThe Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, especially with the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to become the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. The band also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, progressive rock and heavy metal. By the end of the decade, the group were seen as an embodiment of the era's sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song \"All You Need Is Love\".\n\nOver the 1960s as a whole, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts.

Oftentimes, people purchase chickens at local feed stores, or through a hatchery.\n\nCreating a brooder - Chickens not being raised by a mother hen need assistance from their owner to survive. Chickens are raised in a brooder, which can look like a variety of things. Many individuals create their own brooder out of cardboard, plastic or wood. Different sources identify a variety of different square feet per bird needed, but a rule of thumb can be two square feet per chicken. This number can be lowered when the chick is young, but as they grow they will need at least two square feet per bird. It is important that chicken owners place their brooder in a draft-free place, yet still allow holes in the brooder for ventilation.[citation needed]\n\nHeating and bedding - Chicks require a warm environment. In a brooder, this warm environment is created artificially with a heat lamp. My Pet Chicken recommends a red heat lamp, because a white heat lamp can create a harsh and uncomfortable environment for the baby chicks. During the first week of the chicks' life, a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit is required. The temperature can be decreased by 5 degrees F. each week of the chicks life, until they reach week 6. At week 6, the birds should have enough feathers grown to be moved into their chicken coop. Checking on chicks often is important, as chicks that are too cold will huddle together to attempt to retain warmth, and chicks that are too hot will spread out in the brooder in attempts to cool down. Temperature can be adjusted accordingly by lowering and raising the heat lamp in the chick's brooder. Temperature can also be monitored by the use of a thermometer.[citation needed] Wooden chips are often used in the bottom of the brooder as a bedding.[21]\n\nFood and water - Chicks require different food than adult chickens. Chicks need a mash or dust food so that they are able to digest it without grit. Adult chickens are able to digest grit, which allows them to eat bigger food pellets. Purchasing chick food from a local feed store that is specifically for baby chicks will ensure that all nutritional requirements are being met. There are different types of food for different types of chicks. Chicks that are grown for egg-laying purposes require a lower protein level than chicks that are grown as a source of meat. Chicks should be fed and given water out of containers that ensure the chicks' safety, as some containers can injure the chicks or cause easy drowning.[21]", "response": "When raising backyard chickens, there are several considerations for chick care.

Specifically, in the context of business intelligence, you are typically presenting facts and insights about a business to stakeholders in order for them to take action and make better decisions to run that business. \n\nGood data visualisation combines user experience design with an understanding of how people interpret data to provide something intuitive and compelling for the intended audience to use. \n\nHere are some examples of design and interpretation choices you might make:\n\nIn terms of design, many cultures write on a page from top to bottom, left to right. This means that the first place on any visualisation that a person from any of these cultures will look is top left. Consequently, the content you put in the top left space of your dashboard should be a critically important part of the story you are trying to tell. In a culture that writes right to left you might put higher-value content on the right-hand side of the visualisation. \n\nIn terms of in terms interpretation you want to key into things that people are naturally good at interpreting. For example, if you are presenting sales by product category and you have 10 product categories you could choose to leverage a bar chart where the length of the bar represents sales or a pie chart where the angle of the slice represents sales. A bar chart would be a better choice because people find it easy to compare the length of a bar. We cannot distinguish between the sizes of a slice with anywhere near the same level of accuracy.

Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are available from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997)[13] and Cramer (1991).[14] The Journal of Personality published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).[15]\n\nIn the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936),[16] Anna Freud enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that appear in the works of her father, Sigmund Freud: repression, regression, reaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against one's own person, reversal into the opposite, and sublimation or displacement.[17]\n\nSigmund Freud posited that defence mechanisms work by distorting id impulses into acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these impulses.[16] Anna Freud considered defense mechanisms as intellectual and motor automatisms of various degrees of complexity, that arose in the process of involuntary and voluntary learning.[18]\n\nAnna Freud introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was \"not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the ego of an anticipated instinctual tension\".[16] The signalling function of anxiety was thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the organism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an increase in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism receives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action regarding the perceived danger.\n\nBoth Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and research on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation.[19]\n\nRepression: when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable\nRegression: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as \"less demanding and safer\"[19]\nProjection: possessing a feeling that is deemed as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or \"unconscious urge\" is seen in the actions of other people[19]\nReaction formation: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, \"often exaggerated and obsessive\". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to – rather than cheat – become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.[19]\nSublimation: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways[19]\nOtto F. Kernberg (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be borderline personality disorder. His theory is based on ego psychological object relations theory. Borderline personality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and harmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.[20]\n\nIn George Eman Vaillant's (1977) categorization, defences form a continuum related to their psychoanalytical developmental level.[21][non-primary source needed] They are classified into pathological, immature, neurotic and \"mature\" defences.\n\nRobert Plutchik's (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic emotions, which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures. According to his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial relates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and passivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to sadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement to anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and obsessionality).[22]\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) published by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic axis for defence mechanisms.[23] This classification is largely based on Vaillant's hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples include: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection, and displacement.", "response": "There are multiple definitions of defense mechanism based on different theories. Generally, defense mechanisms are human responses responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation.

{"instruction": "What are the primary breathing apparatuses for scuba", "context": "Breathing apparatus\nMain article: Scuba set\n\nRecreational diver putting on his scuba set before diving\nThe defining equipment used by a scuba diver is the eponymous scuba, the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which allows the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported by the diver. It is also commonly referred to as the scuba set.\n\nAs one descends, in addition to the normal atmospheric pressure at the surface, the water exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure of approximately 1 bar (14.7 pounds per square inch) for every 10 m (33 feet) of depth. The pressure of the inhaled breath must balance the surrounding or ambient pressure to allow controlled inflation of the lungs. It becomes virtually impossible to breathe air at normal atmospheric pressure through a tube below three feet under the water.[2]\n\nMost recreational scuba diving is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece to supply the breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers are more likely to use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.[43]\n\nOpen-circuit\nMain article: Diving regulator\n\nAqualung Legend second stage (demand valve) regulator\n\nAqualung first stage regulator\n\nGekko dive computer with attached pressure gauge and compass\n\nSuunto submersible pressure gauge display\nOpen circuit scuba has no provision for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration.[1] The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase the buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.[23]\n\nThe most commonly used scuba set uses a \"single-hose\" open circuit 2-stage demand regulator, connected to a single back-mounted high-pressure gas cylinder, with the first stage connected to the cylinder valve and the second stage at the mouthpiece.[1] This arrangement differs from Émile Gagnan's and Jacques Cousteau's original 1942 \"twin-hose\" design, known as the Aqua-lung, in which the cylinder pressure was reduced to ambient pressure in one or two stages which were all in the housing mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold.[23] The \"single-hose\" system has significant advantages over the original system for most applications.[44]\n\nIn the \"single-hose\" two-stage design, the first stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about 300 bars (4,400 psi) to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about 8 to 10 bars (120 to 150 psi) above ambient pressure. The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a low-pressure hose from the first stage, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver's mouth. The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a non-return valve on the second stage housing. The first stage typically has at least one outlet port delivering gas at full tank pressure which is connected to the diver's submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder.[44]\n\nRebreather\n\nAn Inspiration electronic fully closed circuit rebreather\nMain article: Diving rebreather\nLess common are closed circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers which, unlike open-circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process all or part of each exhaled breath for re-use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver.[45] Rebreathers release few or no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume, for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered; this has advantages for research, military,[1] photography, and other applications. Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open-circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used, due to the larger variety of potential failure modes.[45]\n\nIn a closed-circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled, so it can be maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial pressure in the breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real-time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems. Because rebreathers produce very few bubbles, they do not disturb marine life or make a diver's presence known at the surface; this is useful for underwater photography, and for covert work.[36]", "response": "The most common breathing apparatus for Scuba Diving is an open circuit single hose 2-stage demand regulator connected to a single gas cylinder.

According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley,[8] and Dow Chemical[9] were also among the targets.\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices.[1] Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.[10]\n\nThe attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.[11]\n\nAccording to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways—much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"[12]\n\nHistory\n\nFlowers left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it might leave the country\nOn January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted.[9] As a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China.[1] On the same day, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China.[13]\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News reported that the United States Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.[14]\n\nIn Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\".[15] The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.[16]\n\nAttackers involved\nFurther information: Cyberwarfare by China\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists.[17] Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.[2][18]\n\nThe \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.[19]\n\nElderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company – a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.[2]\n\nAttack analysis\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\".[20] However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.[1]\n\nSecurity experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack.[11] Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue,[21] and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September.[22] Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.[23][24]\n\nVeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".[25]\n\nAccording to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\"[26] The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\"[27] According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"[28]\n\nOnce a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\n\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down.[29] However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.[3]\n\nResponse and aftermath\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made.[30][31][32] The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.[33][34]\n\nIn an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.[35]\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"[36]\n\nSecurity company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites.[37] According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week.[clarification needed] \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update.[38] Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19.[39] According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.[39]\n\nResearchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8—even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.[dubious – discuss] According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"[40]\n\nMicrosoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September.[22] Work on an update was prioritized[41] and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities.[42] They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\n\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.[43]\n\nOn February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School.[44] As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China.[45] Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.[46][47]\n\nIn March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.[48]\n\nGoogle retrospective\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series[49] covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts.", "response": "Google, Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical appear to have been targted in these attacks.

{"instruction": "What is a phenotype?", "context": "", "response": "In genetics and genomics, the phenotype  is the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism. The term covers the organism's morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting the phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as \"extended phenotypes\".\n\nWilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype–phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's hereditary material and what that hereditary material produces. The distinction resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834–1914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently, in The Selfish Gene (1976), Dawkins distinguished these concepts as replicators and vehicles.\n\nThe genotype–phenotype distinction should not be confused with Francis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to protein, and not the reverse.", "category": "open_qa"}

These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word \"wealth\" for \"goods and services\" meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity, which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science.\" Citing Robbins: \"Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\". After discussing it for decades, Robbins' definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks. Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition. Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters.", "response": "Jean-Baptiste Say - Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth;  Lionel Robbins - Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science", "category": "information_extraction"}

The sightseeing also is impressive, with modern architecture combined with classic structures, and many museums to fill your days. Getting around Paris is very easy, as it is a very walkable city and also has an efficient and relatively inexpensive public transportation system.  \n\nFor a lake vacation, Lake Como is wonderful, and in particular Bellagio, which is widely regarded as the prettiest village in Lake Como.  Getting to Bellagio is fairly easy, as it’s close to Milan.  The food is reasonably priced, although it’s generally northern Italian food (with limited options for other ethnic food).  Transportation around the lake is convenient with an efficient ferry service on Lake Como, although getting into the individual villages can be a bit challenging given the hills (so expect to walk!).  Many villages near Bellagio are also very quaint, and within walking distance – you’ll definitely get good exercise going from village to village.\n\nFor a seaside vacation, Dubrovnik is a great choice.  It’s not so convenient to get there from the United States, especially for those in the western United States since there are no direct flights.  However, it’s well worth the trip.

{"instruction": "The paper \"Attention is all you need\" proposed the Transformer model for the first time, which had a profound impact on the subsequent LLM. Please give the main core idea of Transformer described in this paper", "context": "A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).\n\nLike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.\n\nTransformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.", "response": "This paper is by Vaswani, Ashish & Shazeer, Noam & Parmar, Niki & Uszkoreit, Jakob & Jones, Llion & Gomez, Aidan & Kaiser, Lukasz & Polosukhin, Illia. and published in 2017.

The legend goes back to the fabled battle of Kurukshetra fought between the five Pandava brothers and their cousins, the 100 Kaurava brothers, which is the pivot of the Mahabharata. Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.\n\nA folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slayed their cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (“hidden Kashi” — the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple, Bhaktapur district Nepal.[4][5]\n\nA variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas.[4] After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed]. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.\n\nAfter completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.[6]\n\nResearch and findings\nThe Hindu activist Bharat Jangam had been researching and claiming that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Kedarnath based on the surprising links between Kedarnath and Doleshwor. The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese. The priests in both shrines are selected from India's southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both priests affix the word ‘ling’ after their names to convey their proximity to the god as his worshipper and both temples have a cluster of five Shiva shrines. The main deity of both priests is Birbhadra, a companion of Shiva, according to Hindu scriptures.

The first album contained the song \"I AM HERE.\" While I have been told there are at least two versions of this song, one version of the song was recently sung by David and can be listened to at Crossroads Church website though the external link I have placed in the external links. The link will be preceded by the number 2.\n\nIn 1997 Wolfenberger's band the Marshwiggles released their first and only album Stone Soup on the local Cincinnati label Blue Jordan Records. It was played nationally and the band toured regionally to sizable crowds but broke up during the recording of their second album just prior to its completion and release.[citation needed] This album has never been released although tracks from it have shown up on Blue Jordan compilations. Wolfenberger then formed the band Thom Scarecrow with acoustic guitarist Jason Dennie and fellow Marshwiggles, Tony Moore and Joshua Seurkamp. This would be a short-lived ensemble lasting just over a year.\n\nIn 1999 Wolfenberger's first solo album, Tales From Thom Scarecrow was released and won him Artist of the Year in his hometown at the Cincinnati Entertainment Awards as well as notoriety abroad from such notable media as the Corriere della Sera in Milan, Italy which stated that \"Wolfenberger puts forth folk with dark nuances, the grand introspective songs are illuminated with emotions in this exhibition of his life.\"[1]\n\nIn 2000 he joined iconoclastic songwriters Mark Olson and Victoria Williams as a touring and recording member of the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers. In 2001 while still touring with the Creekdippers Wolfenberger recorded his second solo album with his band entitled World of the Satisfyn' Place. This album was decidedly more roots oriented than his first (a return to his style with the Marshwiggles and Thom Scarecrow) and swung wildly from raucous to thoughtful on a song to song basis.,[2] It was even more well received by the critics. The Detroit Metro Times stated that \"Wolfenberger ambles between homespun Appalachian traditions and classic pop and country forms with an unwavering dedication to simple, gorgeous melodies that are alternately uplifting and devastating.\"[3] While in Britain, Americana-UK called it \"a 100% solid gold classic\".[4] and his hometown Cincinnati press named it \"one of the best albums (local or national) of the year\".[5]\n\nIn the following two years he would appear on two Creekdipper albums, release a free folk gospel album under the pseudonym Sunrise for Someone and eventually in 2003 stop touring and recording with the Creekdippers although maintaining a close relationship, which would become apparent with the release of his third solo album entitled Portrait of Narcissus in 2006 which featured fellow Creekdippers, Victoria Williams, Joshua Grange (by then a regular member of Dwight Yoakam's band), and fellow independent folkie Michelle Shocked. This would be Wolfenberger's first album to be distributed beyond America and Europe into Asia and Australia due to its release by recently revived Fundamental Records. It would even end up at No. 12 on the independent Euro Americana Chart[6]\n\nIn July 2008 Wolfenberger recorded and made available another folk gospel project under the pseudonym Sunrise for Someone entitled Summer Lake Champion. In August of the same year he released Just Burned Upon The Page a live and mostly solo recording of 7 songs.

Two decades before the crisis, the U.S Government implemented multiple new laws to help encourage financing for affordable housing.  However, in 1999, portions of the Glass-Steagall act, which was passed by congress in 1933, was repealed and as a result, created more overall risk in the financial system as it allowed institutions to commingle low risk real estate investments with riskier investment operations.  The final major factor was a large increase in predatory home loan lending practices which targeted low-income, low-credit, uninformed homebuyers (mostly racial minorities).

{"instruction": "What factors should I considering when selecting a tennis racquet?", "context": "", "response": "There are a series of factors when considering to purchase a tennis racquets.  Primary factors include head size, length, weight, stiffness, and swingweight  \n\nHead size - Power is closely correlated to head size - the larger the head size, the more power can be generated, all other factors being equal.  A larger head size also provides larger hitting area and 'sweetspot'.  Smaller head sizes tend to equate to more control and maneuverability. \n\nLength - The standard length is a 27 inches, but can range from 26.5 inches to 29 inches.  A longer racquets provides more reach and often results in more power.  Similar to head size, longer racquets may limit maneuverability and control. \n\nWeight - The heavier the racquet, the more power you will generate (increasing the 'swingweight') of the racquet.  The lighter the racquet, the more maneuverable and easier it will be for players to get the racket to the right swing position.  The balance of the racquet is also critical as part of weight.  A more head light racket (more weight in the handle) provides increased maneuverability, especially when using a heavier racquet. A more balanced or head heavy racket are often reserved for lighter racquets to maintain the mass behind the ball\n\nStiffness - Generally speaking, the stiffer the racket, the less energy is lost as the ball is redirected with your racquet and thus, creating more power.  More flexible racquets allow for more feel and control.  Flexible racquets provide more comfort as less shock and impact is transferred to the arm and elbow.\n\nSwingweight - Swingweight measures how heavy a racquet feels when you swing it and the amount of power you can transfer to the ball.  Higher swingweight will also provide more stability in the racquet but will sacrifice maneuverability.", "category": "general_qa"}

For example, the same woman is the love interest of two brothers. Soap operas are also known for a character’s unidentified paternity, also known as “Who’s the Daddy?” or WTD storyline. Such a plot point typically arises from the previously mentioned love triangle.\n\nAnother element soap operas are best known for is soap opera rapid aging syndrome (SORAS), in which a child character is not seen on-screen for a long period of time so that the character is rapidly aged so that they may now participate in adult storylines.\n\nThe final element that characterizes a soap opera is a secret relative that seemingly appears out of nowhere, usually to challenge a main character for power.\n\nThe best known examples of soap operas are shows on daytime television such as General Hospital, Days of Our Lives, and The Young & the Restless. However, soap operas can also include primetime shows such as Grey’s Anatomy and even blockbuster movies such as Black Panther and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which exhibit many elements that allow for these works to be considered soap operas.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "Why should people convert lawns and ornamental gardens to native plants?", "context": "", "response": "Who doesn’t love butterflies? They are a beautiful symbol of innocence. But have you noticed there are fewer and fewer every year? When I was a kid, you couldn’t take a trip without getting some butterflies on the windshield of your car. So why are there so few and what does it mean?\n\nOne of the main reasons is the use of pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are indiscriminate killers. And they knock the whole ecosystem out of balance. In my yard, I have seen how a little patience will put things back into balance. I had aphids, but slowly noticed aphid predators solving the problem. I had flies due to my chicken coop, but over a few weeks I saw Swallows and Phoebes move in to take advantage of the food source.\n\nThe other reason we see fewer butterflies is food for caterpillars. Most butterflies and moths (or butterflies of the night as I like to call them) need a particular plant to host their caterpillars. For Monarch butterflies, it is Milkweed (Asclepias), which is an unfortunate name for a beautiful plant. For Pipevine Swallowtails, it is Pipevine (Aristolochia). Without these plants, caterpillars have no source of food. And as cities and suburbs become paved over, there is no place for these once abundant plants to grow. As we look at our own yards, they contain beautiful plants that are imported from other places. But to a butterfly, our yards seem like deserts. Even plants like bottlebrush, which attract a lot of insects for nectar, provide no food for native baby insects. It’s kind of like having a bar for the adults to drink at, but no food to nourish their children so they can grow to be adults too. \n\nBut Doug Tallamy, an entomologist from University of Delaware, says we can help. By putting some native plants in our yards, we can provide the food to bring back butterflies.\n\nAs we prepared to redo our garden from evergreen ornamentals, to an English cottage/cut flower garden, something happened. We saw Doug Tallamy speak on a CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom Meeting. And we realized we had to change our direction, and begin gardening with natives. \n\nAs we look at our garden, the key is that we are just beginning…\nIt is a grand experiment to see what works where. And already the garden is talking to us. The blue eyed grass has jumped the paved walkway to another part of the garden! We expect more movement and magic in the future. Here are some of our thoughts on our garden.\n\nBlessings… Having a giant oak tree in our yard and creek behind us have certainly given us a leg up in terms of food and wildlife access to our yard.\n\nDownside… Lots of shade. Only two, maybe three spots in our garden that get good sun. So, we troll through Calscape looking for plants that will tolerate shade. (If you haven't met Calscape you are in for a treat. I hope you live in California though...).\n\nGoal… As Talamites, we believe in feeding the ecosystem, which starts with caterpillar farming. So how has that worked out? Well, we’ve only seen one or two caterpillars so far. Sigh. It’s all an experiment…\n\nBiggest impact… Leaving the leaves the past year. We can already see the soil improving, and everytime we water we see lots of insects rising up out of the litter. So it is happening. Slowly…\n\nSo we continue to replace non-natives with natives. Last weekend we took out Sarcococca and Pierris Japonicas and replaced them with Coffeeberry (Frangula Californica). This weekend we removed two maple trees and replaced them with Bush Anemone (Carpenteria Californica). And next weekend we are going to replace our box hedge with Coyote Brush (Baccharis pilularis). \n\nBesides the bugs, we've seen lots of other great wildlife in our yard. A new nest of baby squirrels is born in the tree every year. And this year we were surprised by 3 baby raccoons moving into the tree (it is largely hollow).\n\nThey are sweet shy and adorable.

In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself.[16] When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.[43]\n\nThere are several awards presented to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament. The player who has the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase, while players who score a hole-in-one or a double eagle win a large crystal bowl.[44] For each eagle a player makes, they receive a pair of crystal goblets.", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "What is the best kind of shade tree for a backyard in growing region 6?", "context": "", "response": "There are many great trees homeowners in growing region 6 may want to consider for their backyard depending on their priorities. \n\nFirst, the two main types of trees are deciduous, trees that lose their leaves each winter, and evergreen, which retain their foliage year round. Many of the most popular shade trees are deciduous trees, however there are some great evergreen options as well.\n\nStarting with deciduous trees, there are flowering trees and traditional shade trees. Of the traditional shade trees, you may want to consider maples and oaks, of which there are many varieties. Red maples grow a bit slower than silver maples, but have hardier bark, beautiful red leaves in the fall, and a more pleasing traditional branching habit that many prefer vs, Silver maples. Sugar maples growth slower still, but are beautiful, prized trees that turn glowing orange in the fall and produce the sap used in maple syrup come spring. These trees can be 40-70 feet tall at maturity. Oaks are incredibly beautiful trees that are typically a little slower growing than maples, but have strong bark, enabling them to survive harsher conditions and have a long lifespan. They can handle being used as street trees as they do fine with moderate pollution levels and salt from de-icing. You really can't go wrong with maples or oaks as a summer shade tree, with their tall canopies providing wonderful shade once their leaves fill in during the spring.\n\nSome popular flowering options that provide ample shade include cherry and magnolia trees, both of which have beautiful showy spring flowers and reach a height of 20-60 feet at maturity depending on which of the many variants you choose (be careful with this as some are best suited to warmer climates and don't tolerate the cold as well). \n\nFor evergreens, the options are a bit more limited as many of these trees have low canopies that extend all the way to the ground. Many species of spruce and fir tree can have their canopies raised as they mature, creating space underneath for shade. Some pine trees have ample canopy under them, however their thin needle density can limit the amount of shade they provide.\n\nWhichever you ultimately choose, Shade trees add a ton of value to a home and are a great investment. Consider working with an arborist to make the decision based on your lighting and soil conditions. Enlisting a professional's help with planting will ensure your new tree is set up to grow healthy and strong.", "category": "general_qa"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between the Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche methods of paying off debt?", "context": "", "response": "The Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche are two widely known methods of paying off debt. One is a mathematically faster way to pay off the debt; whereas, the alternative is slightly slower but is more psychologically motivating. This motivation is what helps the person reach their debt pay off goals. The following set of debts will be used as the basis for explaining each method:\n\nDebt A has a balance of $10,000 at a 4% interest rate. \nDebt B has a balance of $5,000 at a 10% interest rate.\nDebt C has a balance of $8,000 at a 24% interest rate. \n\nThe Debt Avalanche is typically the fastest and most cost effective way to pay off debt. The person makes minimum payments on all their debts and any extra goes towards the account with highest interest rate (Debt C in example above). Once that first balance is paid off, the person takes the payments from that and puts it all towards the second highest interest rate (Debt B). Repeat until all debts are paid.\n\nThe Debt Snowball is a method popularized by a personal finance expert, Dave Ramsey, in Step 2 of his 7 Baby Steps to building wealth. This method uses psychology by paying off the smallest balance first (Debt B above). The theory is that the feeling of quickly paying off a debt balance provides the motivation to stick with the program. Similar to the Debt Avalanche, the person takes the payments from Debt B and puts it towards the next smallest balance (Debt C). Repeat until all debts are paid.", "category": "open_qa"}

{"instruction": "Write a brief paragraph about the evolution of Egyptian pyramids.", "context": "", "response": "Egyptian pyramids are fascinating ancient buildings edified more than 2500 years before the Common Era. According to Egyptologists, these megalithic structures served as tombs for the biggest pharaohs that successively ruled the region in that Era. The biggest ones, present until now in Giza, are built with astonishing precision using the rudimental tools and materials that were available at that time. For example, Khufu pyramid, culminating at 481 feet, is an architectural masterpiece. The size, orientation and precision of this pyramid are keeping the best current architects agape. However, the journey was not straightforward for ancient Egyptians. Building such megalithic structures remains very hard to even nowadays. Before achieving the precision of the pyramids on Giza plateau, some inconsistencies and simpler trials are still present in Egypt showing the progressive improvement in their construction know-how through time. The first historically documented pyramid in Egypt is attributed to Djozer pharaoh in the third dynastic period. It is a stepped structure with superposed squares without big attention to the external design and polishment that we find later in the more recent pyramids. Egyptologists proved the existence of many other attempts to build similar structures in the same dynasty. However, the first complete pyramid structures appeared only in the 4th dynasty, giving successively the rise of the great pyramids of Meidum, Dahshur, and Giza", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "What are the general rules of the Baseball?", "context": "Baseball is played between two teams with nine players in the field from the team that is not batting at that point (the batting team would have one batter in play at \"home plate\" on the field). On a baseball field, the game is under the authority of several umpires. There are usually four umpires in major league games; up to six (and as few as one) may officiate depending on the league and the importance of the game. There are three bases. Numbered counterclockwise, first, second, and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred to as bags) shaped as 15 in (38 cm) squares which are raised a short distance above the ground; together with home plate, the fourth \"base\", they form a square with sides of 90 ft (27.4 m) called the diamond. Home plate is a pentagonal rubber slab 17 in (43.2 cm) wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections:\n\nThe infield, containing the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by the foul lines and within the grass line (see figure).\nThe outfield is the grassed area beyond the infield grass line between the foul lines and bounded by a wall or fence.\nFoul territory is the entire area outside the foul lines.\nThe pitcher's mound is located in the center of the infield. It is an 18 ft (5.5 m) diameter mound of dirt no higher than 10 in (25.4 cm). Near the center of the mound is the pitching rubber, a rubber slab positioned 60 ft 6 in (18.4 m) from home plate. The pitcher must have one foot on the rubber at the start of every pitch to a batter, but the pitcher may leave the mound area once the ball is released.\n\nAt the college/professional level, baseball is played in nine innings in which each team gets one turn to bat and tries to score runs while the other pitches and defends in the field. High school baseball plays seven innings and Little League uses six-inning games. An inning is broken up into two halves in which the away team bats in the top (first) half, and the home team bats in the bottom (second) half. In baseball, the defense always has the ball—a fact that differentiates it from most other team sports. The teams switch every time the defending team gets three players of the batting team out. The winner is the team with the most runs after nine innings. If the home team is ahead after the top of the ninth, play does not continue into the bottom half. When this happens, an X is put on the scoreboard for the home team's score in the ninth inning. In the case of a tie, additional innings are played until one team comes out ahead at the end of an inning. If the home team takes the lead anytime during the bottom of the ninth or of any inning after that, play stops and the home team is declared the winner. This is known as a walk-off.\n\nThe basic contest is always between the pitcher for the fielding team and a batter. The pitcher throws—pitches—the ball towards home plate, where the catcher for the fielding team waits (in a crouched stance) to receive it. Behind the catcher stands the home plate umpire. The batter stands in one of the batter's boxes and tries to hit the ball with a bat. The pitcher must keep one foot in contact with the top or front of the pitcher's rubber—a 24×6 in (61×15 cm) plate located atop the pitcher's mound—during the entire pitch, so he can take only one step backward and one forward in delivering the ball. The catcher's job is to receive any pitches that the batter does not hit and to \"call\" the game by a series of hand movements that signal to the pitcher what pitch to throw and where. The catcher also usually signals the desired location of the ball within the strike zone and \"sets up\" behind the plate or holds his glove up in the desired location as a target. The catcher's role becomes more crucial depending on how the game is going, and how the pitcher responds to a given situation. Each pitch begins a new play, which might consist of nothing more than the pitch itself.\n\nEach half-inning, the goal of the defending team is to get three members of the other team out. A player who is out must leave the field and wait for his next turn at bat. There are many ways to get batters and baserunners out; some of the most common are catching a batted ball in the air, tag outs, force outs, and strikeouts. After the fielding team has put out three players from the opposing team, that half of the inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places; there is no upper limit to the number that may bat in rotation before three outs are recorded. Going through the entire order in an inning is referred to as \"batting around\" and it is indicative of a high-scoring inning. A complete inning consists of each opposing side having a turn (three outs) on offense.\n\nThe goal of the team at bat is to score more runs than the opposition; a player may do so by batting, then becoming a baserunner, touching all the bases in order (via one or more plays), and finally touching home plate. A player may also become a baserunner by being inserted as a pinch-runner. To that end, the goal of each batter is to enable baserunners to score or to become a baserunner himself. The batter attempts to hit the ball into fair territory—between the baselines—in such a way that the defending players cannot get them or the baserunners out. In general, the pitcher attempts to prevent this by pitching the ball in such a way that the batter cannot hit it cleanly or, ideally, at all.\n\nA baserunner who has successfully touched home plate without being retired (called out) after touching all previous bases scores a run. In an enclosed field, a fair ball hit over the fence on the fly is an automatic home run, which entitles the batter and all runners to touch all the bases and score. On a field with foul poles, a ball that hits a pole is also a home run. A home run hit with all bases occupied ('bases loaded') is called a grand slam.", "response": "Baseball is a game contested between two teams of 9 players. The defense plays the field and has the ball, and the offense can score by batting the ball and making their way around the bases. The field consists of two parts, the infield, which contains the bases, and the outfield. The bases are 90 feet apart, arranged in diamond format, and advanced counterclockwise. The pitcher's mound is in the center of the infield and is 60 feet 6 inches away from home plate (where the batter stands to try and bat the ball). At the youth level, the bases may be placed as close as 60 feet apart, and the mound may be as close as 46 feet away. The infield contains 6 of the 9 defenders, the pitcher being on the pitcher's mound, the catcher positioned behind home plate to receive the ball from the pitcher, and 4 infielders. The 1st baseman and 2nd baseman are positioned on the right side of the infield near their respective bases. The shortstop and third baseman are positioned on the left side of the infield with the shortstop shaded closer to 2nd base, in a mirrored position from the 2nd baseman. The third baseman is positioned by third base. The outfielders are the 3 remaining defensive players positioned in the large grass outfield in a left, center, and right arrangement. The pitcher must deliver the ball over the plate at the height range of the player's knees to their torso. 3 pitches at this level or swings and misses count as an out. Balls batted that don't land in play, which the lines of play extend from the point of the home plate which is a 90-degree angle count as a strike as long it strikes one or two, a batter cannot foul out for the third strike. If a pitched ball is not called a strike it is a ball, and 4 balls in an at-bat award the batter first base via what is called a walk. Other ways to make outs are if a ball is batted and the fielders catch it before it hits the ground; if the ball hits the ground the runner can be declared out of the fielders touch the base of the advancing runner with possession of the ball prior to the runners' arrival, so long as the runner is forced to advance to the base. If there is no force, the runner must be tagged out. In the event of a fly-out, any runner must re-establish possession of the bag they started at and are not allowed to advance to the next base until the fielder catches the ball. If they don't re-establish possession of their originating base they can be called out if the ball and the fielder possessing it reaches the originating base before they do. 3 outs constitute a half-inning; after each half-inning, the teams rotate from offense to defense. After each team gets 3 outs the full inning is concluded. A game is complete after 9 innings, although youth games are usually 6 or 7 innings. If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, the teams will continuously add extra innings until the tie is broken. A ball that is batted over the outfield fence is considered a homerun and the batter and all base runners can advance safely to home. If a battled ball lands in fair territory and leaves the field of play, it is considered a ground-rule double, and all runners are awarded two bases from where they started. You can substitute players from your bench into the game at any time but players are not allowed to re-enter the game once substituted, so substitutions are done sparingly and strategically. Many leagues employ the designated hitter rule, which allows for a 10th player to bat in place of the pitcher. Balls, strikes, and outs are called by umpires, of which there can be anywhere between 2 and 4.", "category": "information_extraction"}

During the glare of the Wisconsin governor's race of 1900, his mother and older brother and sister returned to Primrose with cousin Robert and other family members to visit the old log cabin where Harvey was born and to relive memories of the pioneering days of a half century earlier.[10] During the next decade, Harvey and his wife were often in Washington, DC, visiting family members and meeting political allies. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was a friend from his younger days in Indiana.[11] His brother and cousin both moved to the nation's capitol as members of Congress, and he visited them often. Later in his life, when the mines no longer produced and his business failed, he returned to his academic roots, corresponding with Abraham Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren, who wrote The Lincoln and LaFollette Families in Pioneer Drama,[12] a history of the Lincoln and LaFollette families on the Kentucky frontier in the years before Jesse LaFollette and Thomas Lincoln took their families across the Ohio River to settle in Indiana Territory.[13]\n\nFamily\nHe was a member of the La Follette family. William La Follette was a younger brother. Robert M. La Follette Sr. was his first cousin. William Leroy LaFollette Jr. and Chester La Follette were nephews. Suzanne La Follette was a niece. Mimi LaFollette Summerskill was a grand niece. Her son was political leader Richard L. Wright. His only child, Warner Marion LaFollette, predeceased him. Harvey was visiting his brother, William, in Colfax, Washington when he died in 1929.[5] Both he and William and other LaFollette family members are interred in the Colfax Cemetery in Whitman County, Washington.[14]", "category": "summarization"}

During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. The terms \"Byzantine Empire\" and \"Eastern Roman Empire\" were coined after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire and to themselves as Romans[note 2]—a term which Greeks continued to use for themselves into Ottoman times.

{"instruction": "How is beer made?", "context": "", "response": "Most of the beer we all drink is made from the same four ingredients; barley, water, hops and yeast.The basic idea is to extract the sugars from grains (usually barley) so that the yeast can turn it into alcohol and CO2, creating beer. \n\nIn order for barley to be made into beer, it must first be malted. The malting process renders the grain usable to the brewer. It's basically taking a live seed, steeping it in water and tricking it into thinking it's time to grow.\" The grain starts to ready itself to grow into a plant but the germination is then stopped by drying the barley. Malting helps to create the enzymes necessary to convert the starches present in the seeds into sugars. Without malting, the beer would not have enough sugar content to properly ferment.\n\nThe malted barley is crushed or milled and then soaked in warm water in order to create a sugar solution known as wort. Any other grains used in the brewing process are also added at this point. Soaking the grains in warm water helps to further convert the starches into the sugars necessary for fermentation.\n\nThe wort is then moved to a copper pot and boiled. During boiling, some of the water in the wort evaporates, leaving behind a higher concentration of sugars. Boiling also helps to sterilize the mixture in preparation for fermentation. \n\nAfter boiling, the solid hops and grain are removed, and the mixture is cooled. The brewers then add yeast to this mixture. Fermenting with yeast is what makes beer alcoholic. The time it takes to ferment a beer varies based on type of yeast and style of fermentation, but most beers take about a week to ferment.\n\nDifferent strains of yeast and different fermentation techniques determine what kind of beer is being made and how it will taste. For example, when making a lager, the yeast ferments at the bottom of the wort at a cooler temperature. Ales are made with a different strain of yeast, and top fermented at warmer temperatures. After fermentation, the beer is then cooled again before bottling or canning.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "Summarize the main components of a Kubernetes cluster control plane from this paragraph", "context": "Kubernetes defines a set of building blocks (\"primitives\") that collectively provide mechanisms that deploy, maintain, and scale applications based on CPU, memory[33] or custom metrics.[34] Kubernetes is loosely coupled and extensible to meet different workloads. The internal components as well as extensions and containers that run on Kubernetes rely on the Kubernetes API.[35] The platform exerts its control over compute and storage resources by defining resources as Objects, which can then be managed as such.\n\nKubernetes follows the primary/replica architecture. The components of Kubernetes can be divided into those that manage an individual node and those that are part of the control plane.[35][36]\n\nControl plane\nThe Kubernetes master node handles the Kubernetes control plane of the cluster, managing its workload and directing communication across the system. The Kubernetes control plane consists of various components, each its own process, that can run both on a single master node or on multiple masters supporting high-availability clusters.[36] The various components of the Kubernetes control plane are as follows:\n\netcd[37] is a persistent, lightweight, distributed, key-value data store that CoreOS has developed. It reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the overall state of the cluster at any given point of time. etcd favors consistency over availability in the event of a network partition (see CAP theorem). The consistency is crucial for correctly scheduling and operating services.\nThe API server serves the Kubernetes API using JSON over HTTP, which provides both the internal and external interface to Kubernetes.[35][38] The API server processes and validates REST requests and updates the state of the API objects in etcd, thereby allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across worker nodes.[39] The API server uses etcd's watch API to monitor the cluster, roll out critical configuration changes, or restore any divergences of the state of the cluster back to what the deployer declared. As an example, the deployer may specify that three instances of a particular \"pod\" (see below) need to be running. etcd stores this fact. If the Deployment Controller finds that only two instances are running (conflicting with the etcd declaration),[40] it schedules the creation of an additional instance of that pod.[36]\nThe scheduler is the extensible component that selects on which node an unscheduled pod (the basic entity managed by the scheduler) runs, based on resource availability. The scheduler tracks resource use on each node to ensure that workload is not scheduled in excess of available resources. For this purpose, the scheduler must know the resource requirements, resource availability, and other user-provided constraints or policy directives such as quality-of-service, affinity vs. anti-affinity requirements, and data locality. The scheduler's role is to match resource \"supply\" to workload \"demand\".[41]\nA controller is a reconciliation loop that drives the actual cluster state toward the desired state, communicating with the API server to create, update, and delete the resources it manages (e.g., pods or service endpoints).[42][38] One kind of controller is a Replication Controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails.[42] Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a DaemonSet Controller for running exactly one pod on every machine (or some subset of machines), and a Job Controller for running pods that run to completion (e.g., as part of a batch job).[43] Labels selectors that are part of the controller's definition specify the set of pods that a controller manages.[44]\nThe controller manager is a process that manages a set of core Kubernetes controllers.", "response": "The kubernetes cluster control plane runs on one more more master nodes.

{"instruction": "Based on the reference text, why was the eastern section of the bridge rebuilt?", "context": "The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, known locally as the Bay Bridge, is a complex of bridges spanning San Francisco Bay in California. As part of Interstate 80 and the direct road between San Francisco and Oakland, it carries about 260,000 vehicles a day on its two decks.[3][4] It has one of the longest spans in the United States.\n\nThe toll bridge was conceived as early as the California Gold Rush days, with \"Emperor\" Joshua Norton famously advocating for it, but construction did not begin until 1933. Designed by Charles H. Purcell,[6][7] and built by American Bridge Company, it opened on Thursday, November 12, 1936, six months before the Golden Gate Bridge. It originally carried automobile traffic on its upper deck, with trucks, cars, buses and commuter trains on the lower, but after the Key System abandoned rail service on April 20, 1958, the lower deck was converted to all-road traffic as well. On October 12, 1963, traffic was reconfigured to one way traffic on each deck, westbound on the upper deck, and eastbound on the lower deck, with trucks and buses allowed on the upper deck.[8]\n\nIn 1986, the bridge was unofficially dedicated to former California Governor James Rolph.[9]\n\nThe bridge has two sections of roughly equal length; the older western section, officially known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. Bridge (after former San Francisco Mayor and California State Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr.), connects downtown San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, and the newer unnamed eastern section connects the island to Oakland. The western section is a double suspension bridge with two decks, westbound traffic being carried on the upper deck while eastbound is carried on the lower one. The largest span of the original eastern section was a cantilever bridge.\n\nDuring the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a portion of the eastern section's upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck and the bridge was closed for a month. Reconstruction of the eastern section of the bridge as a causeway connected to a self-anchored suspension bridge began in 2002; the new eastern section opened September 2, 2013, at a reported cost of over $6.5 billion; the original estimate of $250 million was for a seismic retrofit of the existing span.[10][11] Unlike the western section and the original eastern section of the bridge, the new eastern section is a single deck carrying all eastbound and westbound lanes. Demolition of the old east span was completed on September 8, 2018.[12]", "response": "The eastern section of the bridge was rebuilt because a portion of its upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.", "category": "closed_qa"}

The person making the argument expects that the listener will accept the provided definition, making the argument difficult to refute.[18]\nDivine fallacy (argument from incredulity) – arguing that, because something is so incredible or amazing, it must be the result of superior, divine, alien or paranormal agency.[19]\nDouble counting – counting events or occurrences more than once in probabilistic reasoning, which leads to the sum of the probabilities of all cases exceeding unity.\nEquivocation – using a term with more than one meaning in a statement without specifying which meaning is intended.[20]\nAmbiguous middle term – using a middle term with multiple meanings.[21]\nDefinitional retreat – changing the meaning of a word when an objection is raised.[22] Often paired with moving the goalposts (see below), as when an argument is challenged using a common definition of a term in the argument, and the arguer presents a different definition of the term and thereby demands different evidence to debunk the argument.\nMotte-and-bailey fallacy – conflating two positions with similar properties, one modest and easy to defend (the \"motte\") and one more controversial (the \"bailey\").[23] The arguer first states the controversial position, but when challenged, states that they are advancing the modest position.[24][25]\nFallacy of accent – changing the meaning of a statement by not specifying on which word emphasis falls.\nPersuasive definition – purporting to use the \"true\" or \"commonly accepted\" meaning of a term while, in reality, using an uncommon or altered definition.\n(cf. the if-by-whiskey fallacy)\nEcological fallacy – inferring about the nature of an entity based solely upon aggregate statistics collected for the group to which that entity belongs.[26]\nEtymological fallacy – assuming that the original or historical meaning of a word or phrase is necessarily similar to its actual present-day usage.[27]\nFallacy of composition – assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole.[28]\nFallacy of division – assuming that something true of a composite thing must also be true of all or some of its parts.[29]\nFalse attribution – appealing to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument.\nFallacy of quoting out of context (contextotomy, contextomy; quotation mining) – selective excerpting of words from their original context to distort the intended meaning.[30]\nFalse authority (single authority) – using an expert of dubious credentials or using only one opinion to promote a product or idea. Related to the appeal to authority.\nFalse dilemma (false dichotomy, fallacy of bifurcation, black-or-white fallacy) – two alternative statements are given as the only possible options when, in reality, there are more.[31]\nFalse equivalence – describing two or more statements as virtually equal when they are not.\nFeedback fallacy – believing in the objectivity of an evaluation to be used as the basis for improvement without verifying that the source of the evaluation is a disinterested party.[32]\nHistorian's fallacy – assuming that decision-makers of the past had identical information as those subsequently analyzing the decision.[33] This should not to be confused with presentism, in which present-day ideas and perspectives are anachronistically projected into the past.\nHistorical fallacy – believing that certain results occurred only because a specific process was performed, though said process may actually be unrelated to the results.[34]\nBaconian fallacy – supposing that historians can obtain the \"whole truth\" via induction from individual pieces of historical evidence. The \"whole truth\" is defined as learning \"something about everything\", \"everything about something\", or \"everything about everything\". In reality, a historian \"can only hope to know something about something\".[35]\nHomunculus fallacy – using a \"middle-man\" for explanation; this sometimes leads to regressive middle-men. It explains a concept in terms of the concept itself without explaining its real nature (e.g.: explaining thought as something produced by a little thinker – a homunculus – inside the head simply identifies an intermediary actor and does not explain the product or process of thinking).[36]\nInflation of conflict – arguing that, if experts in a field of knowledge disagree on a certain point within that field, no conclusion can be reached or that the legitimacy of that field of knowledge is questionable.[37][38]\nIf-by-whiskey – an argument that supports both sides of an issue by using terms that are emotionally sensitive and ambiguous.\nIncomplete comparison – insufficient information is provided to make a complete comparison.\nIntentionality fallacy – the insistence that the ultimate meaning of an expression must be consistent with the intention of the person from whom the communication originated (e.g. a work of fiction that is widely received as a blatant allegory must necessarily not be regarded as such if the author intended it not to be so).[39]\nKafkatrapping – a sophistical rhetorical device in which any denial by an accused person serves as evidence of guilt.[40][41][42]\nKettle logic – using multiple, jointly inconsistent arguments to defend a position.\nLudic fallacy – failing to take into account that non-regulated random occurrences unknown unknowns can affect the probability of an event taking place.[43]\nLump of labour fallacy – the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work to be done within an economy, which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs.[44]\nMcNamara fallacy (quantitative fallacy) – making an argument using only quantitative observations (measurements, statistical or numerical values) and discounting subjective information that focuses on quality (traits, features, or relationships).\nMind projection fallacy – assuming that a statement about an object describes an inherent property of the object, rather than a personal perception.\nMoralistic fallacy – inferring factual conclusions from evaluative premises in violation of fact–value distinction (e.g.: inferring is from ought). Moralistic fallacy is the inverse of naturalistic fallacy.\nMoving the goalposts (raising the bar) – argument in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded.\nNirvana fallacy (perfect-solution fallacy) – solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect.\nPackage deal – treating essentially dissimilar concepts as though they were essentially similar.\nProof by assertion – a proposition is repeatedly restated regardless of contradiction; sometimes confused with argument from repetition (argumentum ad infinitum, argumentum ad nauseam).\nProsecutor's fallacy – a low probability of false matches does not mean a low probability of some false match being found.\nProving too much – an argument that results in an overly generalized conclusion (e.g.: arguing that drinking alcohol is bad because in some instances it has led to spousal or child abuse).\nPsychologist's fallacy – an observer presupposes the objectivity of their own perspective when analyzing a behavioral event.\nReferential fallacy[45] – assuming that all words refer to existing things and that the meaning of words reside within the things they refer to, as opposed to words possibly referring to no real object (e.g.: Pegasus) or that the meaning comes from how they are used (e.g.: \"nobody\" was in the room).\nReification (concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) – treating an abstract belief or hypothetical construct as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity (e.g.: saying that evolution selects which traits are passed on to future generations; evolution is not a conscious entity with agency).\nRetrospective determinism – believing that, because an event has occurred under some circumstance, the circumstance must have made the event inevitable (e.g.: because someone won the lottery while wearing their lucky socks, wearing those socks made winning the lottery inevitable).\nSlippery slope (thin edge of the wedge, camel's nose) – asserting that a proposed, relatively small, first action will inevitably lead to a chain of related events resulting in a significant and negative event and, therefore, should not be permitted.[46]\nSpecial pleading – the arguer attempts to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule or principle without justifying the exemption (e.g.: an orphaned defendant who murdered their parents asking for leniency).", "response": "Three informal fallacies are:\n- False Authority: Using an expert with dubious credentials to promote an argument\n- Incomplete Comparison: Not enough information was provided to adequately make a comparison\n- Proof by Assertion: Restating the same argument regardless of counter arguments and contradictions", "category": "summarization"}

In terms of trophies won, it is the third-most successful club in English football.\n\nArsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.[4] Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for nineteen consecutive seasons.\n\nHerbert Chapman, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won the club its first silverware, and his legacy led the club to dominate the 1930s decade; Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in 1934, aged 55. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers; he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's jersey. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.\n\nIn 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913 the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of £340.3m in the 2019–20 season, Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.68 billion by Forbes, making it the world's eighth most valuable club,[8] while it is one of the most followed on social media.The motto of the club has long been Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for \"Victory Through Harmony\".", "category": "open_qa"}

The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).\n\nThe series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[1] A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[2] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[3] Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[4]\n\nSince the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature.[5][6] As of February 2023, the books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been available in 85 languages.[7] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.\n\nThe original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[8] making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.\n\nThe success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments.

Driven by ambition and overwhelmed with a duty to honor those who came before her, she will work hard to land the career of her dreams. When she does, one shouldn’t be surprised to see she has accidentally fallen asleep at her desk for the third time in one week and well past working hours. During her sleep, she will surely be dreaming of the day she finally makes it through all the hoops she will have had to jump through to finally achieve the American dream. \n\nIt won’t be until her mid-20s or 30s that she will realize somewhere along the way her drive evolved into another entity entirely, one that made her single-minded and cold-hearted. She will realize that the emotional traits and feelings she denied herself for so long because she didn’t associate them with societal norms of success, were the traits that would eventually yield her the most power. \n\nWhen she does realize this is when she will have made a pivotal step toward her self-actualization. Depending on who she is, she will let her hair loose and swap her loafers for stilettos, unlocking a new level of confidence she didn’t realize was once weighed down by societal prejudices and expectations. She will occasionally use her good looks to her advantage because she will have the confidence to decide for herself which trials to endure and the grace to let herself have flaws. \n\nShe will still worship the likes of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, but alongside them, she will find a soft spot for Cardi B and the confidence and pride her songs ignite in women and in their perception of their bodies. She will find a new respect for her friends who chose to work as stay-at-home moms, though that was not her path. \n\nA young, attractive woman in America might take inspiration from her ancestors on the kind of life she should lead, but she should be just as steadfast in her resolve to stay true to herself and the women of her own generation in pursuit of her goals.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "Which component of a PV solar system implements MPPT?", "context": "Maximum power point tracking (MPPT)[1][2] or sometimes just power point tracking (PPT),[3][4] is a technique used with variable power sources to maximize energy extraction as conditions vary. The technique is most commonly used with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, but can also be used with wind turbines, optical power transmission and thermophotovoltaics.\n\nPV solar systems have varying relationships to inverter systems, external grids, battery banks, and other electrical loads.[5] The central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on the amount of available sunlight, shading, solar panel temperature and the load's electrical characteristics. As these conditions vary, the load characteristic (impedance) that gives the highest power transfer changes. The system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep power transfer at highest efficiency. This optimal load characteristic is called the maximum power point (MPP). MPPT is the process of adjusting the load characteristic as the conditions change. Circuits can be designed to present optimal loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems.\n\nSolar cells' non-linear relationship between temperature and total resistance can be analyzed based on the Current-voltage (I-V) curve and the power-voltage (P-V) curves.[6][7] MPPT samples cell output and applies the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power.[8] MPPT devices are typically integrated into an electric power converter system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors. Solar inverters convert DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT.\n\nThe power at the MPP (Pmpp) is the product of the MPP voltage (Vmpp) and MPP current (Impp).\n\nIn general, the P-V curve of a partially shaded solar array can have multiple peaks, and some algorithms can get stuck in a local maximum rather than the global maximum of the curve.[9]", "response": "An MPPT device is usually integrated into the electric power converter system.

{"instruction": "How do you make brisket on a pellet smoker?", "context": "", "response": "First you need to prepare your pellet smoker by adding pellets and setting the temperature to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  It is common to use oak, mesquite, hickory and pecan pellets.  Next you will need to trim and season your brisket.  It is common to use mustard as a binder for your seasoning but is not required.  Common seasonings for brisket are salt, pepper and garlic.  It is recommend to season the brisket for at least 30 minutes before cooking but for best results allow the seasoned brisket to rest overnight in your refrigerator.  Once the brisket is properly seasoned, place the brisket on your pellet grill.  It is common in Texas to place the brisket fat side up.  In other areas of the country, it is more common to place the brisket fat side down.  Allow your brisket to smoke until it reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees.  Depending on the size of the brisket this could take in excess of 12 hours.  Once the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees, wrap the brisket with butcher paper to build better bark.  Alternatively you can wrap the brisket in foil which will finish the cooking faster but build less bark.  Place the wrapped brisket back in your pellet smoker and increase the temperature to 275 degrees Fahrenheit.  Once the brisket reaches a temperature of 205 degrees Fahrenheit remove the brisket from our pellet smoker and allow it to rest in a cooler or oven until the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees.

In the early 1980s mass-produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture.[5] In Berlin starting in 1989, the Love Parade became the largest street party with over 1 million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.[6]", "response": "With the advent of new electronic instruments in the 60s and 70s, namely synthesizers and drum machines, electronic music quickly gained mainstream popularity through genres like disco and hip hop.

{"instruction": "What is Sauvignon blanc?", "context": "Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the city of Bordeaux in France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage (\"wild\") and blanc (\"white\") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France.[1] It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Bulgaria, the states of Oregon, Washington, and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called \"Fumé Blanc\", a marketing term coined by Robert Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-Fumé.\n\nDepending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and \"green flavors\" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risks losing much aroma from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.", "response": "Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the city of Bordeaux in France.

Chávez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012.\n\nBorn into a middle-class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Chávez became a career military officer and, after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact,[1] he founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. Chávez led the MBR-200 in its unsuccessful coup d'état against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Pardoned from prison two years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement political party, and then receiving 56.2% of the vote, was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8% of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8% of the vote. After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1% of the vote,[2] he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013. However, the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment,[3] and on 5 March at age 58, he died in Caracas.[b][4][5]\n\nFollowing the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, Chávez focused on supposedly enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government nationalized key industries, created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education.[6][7][8][9][10][11] The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez's presidency[12] resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007,[13][12][14] though extensive changes in structural inequalities did not occur.[15] On 2 June 2010, Chávez declared an \"economic war\" on Venezuela's upper classes due to shortages, arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela.[16] By the end of Chávez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade, such as deficit spending[17][18][19] and price controls,[20][21] proved to be unsustainable, with Venezuela's economy faltering. At the same time, poverty,[12][22] inflation[23] and shortages increased.\n\nUnder Chávez, Venezuela experienced democratic backsliding, as he suppressed the press, manipulated electoral laws, and arrested and exiled government critics.[24][25][26] His use of enabling acts[27] and his government's use of propaganda were controversial.[28][29][30][31] Chávez's presidency saw significant increases in the country's murder rate[32][33][page needed] and continued corruption within the police force and government.[34][35]\n\nAcross the political spectrum, Chávez is regarded as one of the most influential and controversial politicians in the modern history of Venezuela and Latin America. His 14-year presidency marked the start of the socialist \"pink tide\" sweeping Latin America—he supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South and the regional television network TeleSUR. Internationally, Chávez aligned himself with the Marxist–Leninist governments of Fidel and then Raúl Castro in Cuba, as well as the socialist governments of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Chávez's ideas, programs, and style form the basis of \"Chavismo\", a political ideology closely associated with Bolivarianism and socialism of the 21st century. Chávez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of neoliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism.

Forty-nine catalog pages[b] with pictures, diagrams and descriptions of espionage devices and spying software were published. The items are available to the Tailored Access Operations unit and are mostly targeted at products from US companies such as Apple, Cisco and Dell. The source is believed to be someone different than Edward Snowden, who is largely responsible for the global surveillance disclosures since 2013. Companies whose products could be compromised have denied any collaboration with the NSA in developing these capabilities.

Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law. Electric potential is typically measured in volts.\nElectricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:\na.

The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution.

{"instruction": "Please give me a short summary of the misinformed public announcements leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall", "context": "The announcement of the regulations which brought down the Wall took place at an hour-long press conference led by Günter Schabowski, the party leader in East Berlin and the top government spokesman, beginning at 18:00 CET on 9 November and broadcast live on East German television and radio. Schabowski was joined by Minister of Foreign Trade Gerhard Beil and Central Committee members Helga Labs and Manfred Banaschak.[1][8]: 352 \n\nSchabowski had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated.[22] Shortly before the press conference, he was handed a note from Krenz announcing the changes, but given no further instructions on how to handle the information. The text stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and also allowed for permanent emigration between all border crossings—including those between East and West Berlin.[18]\n\nAt 18:53, near the end of the press conference, ANSA's Riccardo Ehrman asked if the draft travel law of 6 November was a mistake. Schabowski gave a confusing answer that asserted it was necessary because West Germany had exhausted its capacity to accept fleeing East Germans, then remembered the note he had been given and added that a new regulation had been drafted to allow permanent emigration at any border crossing. This caused a stir in the room; amid several questions at once, Schabowski expressed surprise that the reporters had not yet seen this regulation, and started reading from the note.[1] After this, a reporter, either Ehrman or Bild-Zeitung reporter Peter Brinkmann, both of whom were sitting in the front row at the press conference,[23][24][25] asked when the regulations would take effect.[1] After a few seconds' hesitation, Schabowski replied, \"As far as I know, it takes effect immediately, without delay\" (German: Das tritt nach meiner Kenntnis ... ist das sofort ... unverzüglich).[26][27][8]: 352  This was an apparent assumption based on the note's opening paragraph; as Beil attempted to interject that it was up to the Council of Ministers to decide when it took effect, Schabowski proceeded to read this clause, which stated it was in effect until a law on the matter was passed by the Volkskammer. Crucially, a journalist then asked if the regulation also applied to the crossings to West Berlin. Schabowski shrugged and read item 3 of the note, which confirmed that it did.[1][24]\n\nAfter this exchange, Daniel Johnson of The Daily Telegraph asked what this law meant for the Berlin Wall. Schabowski sat frozen before giving a rambling statement about the Wall being tied to the larger disarmament question.[28][29] He then ended the press conference promptly at 19:00 as journalists hurried from the room.[24][1]\n\nAfter the press conference, Schabowski sat for an interview with NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw in which he repeated that East Germans would be able to emigrate through the border and the regulations would go into effect immediately.[30][31]", "response": "The announcement of the new laws which brought down the Berlin Wall took place at 6 pm on 9 November 1989,  at a live press conference led by Günter Schabowski, the party leader in East Berlin.

{"instruction": "Based on the reference text, provide a bulleted list of the contributing factors causing World War II.", "context": "World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\n\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\n\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe and set the foundation for the international order of the world's nations during the Cold War and into present day. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts,[1] with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.

They finished the regular season with an 11–5 record and a wild card berth to advance to their second Super Bowl appearance through the guidance of several new acquisitions, most notably 21-year veteran quarterback Tom Brady in his first season away from the New England Patriots. The Chiefs, aided by their top-ranked offense, finished the regular season with a league-best 14–2 record to advance to their fourth Super Bowl appearance and were the defending Super Bowl LIV champions, seeking to become the first repeat champions since the Patriots in 2004.[11]\n\nFor the first time under quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs failed to score a touchdown and lost by double-digits, making them the third Super Bowl team to not score a touchdown.[b][12] They also committed 11 penalties for 120 yards, including a record eight penalties for 95 yards in the first half, most of which were called against the defense.[13][14][15][16] The Buccaneers capitalized on these struggles to take a commanding 21–6 lead at halftime and dominated the remainder of the game. Brady, who also extended his player records for Super Bowl appearances to 10 and wins to seven, was named Super Bowl MVP for a record fifth time and was the first to receive the award with multiple franchises.[17][18][19] He became the oldest player to receive the honor and win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback at age 43,[20] breaking additional personal records, while Bruce Arians was the oldest head coach to win the Super Bowl at 68.[21]\n\nThe game was televised nationally by CBS.

{"instruction": "How can I get my dog to stop barking?", "context": "", "response": "There are a few ways to reduce the amount your dog. Dogs can bark for few reasons. Perhaps they want your attention, or they might be fearful or anxious and are barking to alert you. Also, barking habits can also be very breed specific. Some breeds are known to be more vocal than other breeds. It's important to try and understand why they are barking to then initiate the proper course of action to address their barking habits. If you believe they are barking for attention, one idea is to make sure you are not rewarding their barking by distracting them with a treat or playtime. By doing this, you are teaching them that if they bark, the dog will get what they want. Instead, you might want to consider a couple items. First, is the dog getting enough exercise or releasing their energy. Increase their stimulation by walking them more, playing with them, or socializing them with other dogs or humans. This added stimulation may reduce their need for attention. If they are barking because they are fearful or anxious, think about what is happening or what the environment is that may be cause their fear or anxiety. Then, try and change the environment or situation so the dog feels safe. One action that may help is providing a safe place for your dog, such as a dog crate or dog bed, so they know exactly what to do when they are afraid or anxious. Training them to go to their safe place may provide the comfort they need to reduce their barking habits.", "category": "brainstorming"}

JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds (230 to 910 kg).[1] The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the \"joint\" in JDAM.[2] When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.\n\nThe JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a \"bolt-on\" guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.[2]\n\nThe JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions.

It is likely cheaper than any other precision-guided weapons.\n\nGPS navigation provides good targeting precision, typically within meters. Combined with blast radius of 500-2000 lbs unguided bombs, JDAM can effectively destroy any targets on the ground.\n\nBecause JDAM has navigation capability, pilots no longer need to precisely aim the bombers  against the targets. It allows a bomber to quickly and precisely hit multiple targets along the route.\n\nSome JDAM guidance kits include targeting sensors, such as laser targeting. They can be used against mobile targets, which further increases the use cases for JDAM.\n\nIn summary, by combining dumb bombs with a guidance kit, JDAM becomes a very cost effective weapon system, and is widely adopted by the US and other military forces.", "category": "closed_qa"}

The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "response": "The price of Osborne 1 is not mentioned in the passage.

LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "response": "985 million words.", "category": "closed_qa"}
{"instruction": "What is the meaning of Life, The Universe, and Everything?", "context": "", "response": "This topic has been discussed in debt by Theologians, philosophers, and scientists throughout the course of human history.  While most observations about the universe leave the question unanswered the broad strokes are as follows.\n\nTheologians state in many religions that there is an organizing force known as God providing direction to the universe.  Humans that best align with this organizing force or God are guaranteed good fortune in this life or after.  There are variations in humans level of involvement in this process with Christianity requiring a savior (Jesus) for people to enter the afterlife vs achieving a higher state of consciousness in this life or through reincarnation.\n\nPhilosophers differ on the meaning of life with predominate views following down the lines of seeking your own fulfillment or the fulfillment of others.  Seeking your own fulfillment has been a major component of capitalism, self-preservation, and risk taking that lead to new discoveries in Science and Technology.  Seeking the fulfillment of others has lead to great advancements in philanthropy, equality, and the general well being of society.  This \"social compact\" insures stability and provides an expectation that harmful activities like Murder, Robbery, etc are discouraged and punished.\n\nScientists view this question through the lens of the observable universe.  As such efforts have been made to create a \"unifying theory of everything\" to show some understandable order to the universe.  Others have focused their study on the improbability of how humans could have been created in a universe with seemingly random and infinite chance.  Some scientists have conceded that the question is something Science is ill-fitted to answer.\n\nMost importantly Douglas Adams, a prominent British author specializing in absurdity, answered the question in the book \"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\" with the answer \"42.\"", "category": "general_qa"}
